Practice Makes Perfect: Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners, aimed 
­especially at self-taught learners, is designed to serves two purposes for acquiring 
the skills needed to be a confident user of English as a second language. Firstly, it 
is an excellent instrument for practicing the many intricacies of the grammar and 
structure of the English language. Secondly, the book is a resource that contains 
the answers to questions most frequently on the minds of ESL-learners. 
The book is a compilation of seven ESL books that cover the major grammar 
topics that describe and explain how the various parts of speech function in a 
sentence, and, most importantly, it also provides abundant exercises for practice.

In just this one book, the student has a tool for learning and practicing his or her 
new language and a valuable resource that provides immediate answers to 
questions.
Technical terminology has been kept to a minimum but is introduced and 
explained when it is needed to describe an important concept. But the goal of the 
book is to hold such terminology to a minimum. For example, the term elliptical 
clause is a concept that must be memorized because those two words together 
have no precise meaning at first glance and merely stand for a special kind of 
clause. They describe a clause, in which something has been omitted. For 
example:
You are just as smart as Jim. = You are just as smart as Jim is.
The verb (is) is left out of the final clause because it is understood. In this 
book, the term elliptical clause is avoided as much as possible, and the clause is 
more simply described as omitting the verb or leaving out the verb. Those replace-
ment phrases provide simplicity and an instantaneous understanding of how the 
clause is structured. Avoiding technical terminology provides ESL-learners with a 
more ­immediate understanding of material.

Preface
This English All-in-One book provides a comprehensive look at English grammar and its 
usage. In addition, the large abundance of exercises provides a generous opportunity to practice 
what has been learned or a concept that learners may wish to master. ESL-learners are encour-
aged to use the extensive answer key to check for accuracy and as an aid to assess the skill level 
that has been achieved.
One of the great advantages of using a compiled book like this is having access to an all-­
inclusive collection of English grammar topics, thorough explanations of those topics, and a 
­generous amount of exercises with an answer key. It is to the user’s advantage to review both 
small concepts and complete chapters until the ESL-learner’s new skills can be used comfortably 
and confidently.

Nouns
Nouns can be either proper or common. Proper nouns are those that refer to a 
particular person, place, thing, or idea. Such nouns are capitalized: America, 
George Washington, Mr. Neruda, October.
Nouns that do not refer to a particular person, place, thing, or idea are com-
mon nouns. They are not capitalized: land, girls, money, test. Compare the follow-
ing list of proper and common nouns:

 my books
Nouns can be used as the subject of a sentence. The subject is the word that is performing the 
action in the sentence. The subject can be a proper noun or a common noun, and it can be singu-
lar or plural:
Juanita is a friend of mine.
The boys like to play soccer.
Where is the school?
Nouns can also be used as direct objects. The direct object in a sentence is the noun that receives 
the action of the verb. To find the direct object in a sentence, do three things: 
1.	 Find the subject of the sentence.
2.	 Find the verb in the sentence.
3.	 Ask whom or what with the subject and the verb.
Look at these sample sentences:
“Sara likes my brother.”	
“The girls find a book.”
1.	 subject = Sara 	
    1.	 subject = girls
2.	 verb = likes 	
2.	verb = find
3.	 ask whom = Whom does 	
3.	ask what = What do the	
	
	
Sara like?	
	 	
          girls find?
The direct object is my brother.	
The direct object is book.
Nouns are sometimes indirect objects. They stand before the direct object in the sentence. It is the 
person to whom or for whom something is provided. To find the indirect object in a sentence, do 
three things:
	
Nouns	 3
1.	 Find the subject of the sentence.
2.	 Find the verb in the sentence.
3.	 Ask to whom or for whom with the subject and the verb.
Look at these sample sentences:
“Justin buys the girl a magazine.”	
“Mother gives Nate five dollars.”
1.	 subject = Justin	
1.	subject = Mother
2.	 verb = buys	
2.	verb = gives
3.	 ask to whom or for whom = For 	
3.	ask to whom or for whom = To whom  
whom does Justin buy a magazine?	
	does Mother give five dollars?
The indirect object is girl.	
     The indirect object is Nate.
Note: It is rare that something inanimate is used as an indirect object.
When a noun is used as a predicate noun, it follows the predicate in the sentence. The predicate 
can be a single verb or a verb phrase:
Verb as the predicate: Maria helps us.
Verb phrase as the predicate: Maria usually helps with the gardening.
Predicate nouns most often follow the verbs to be and to become:
My mother wants to be a doctor.
Celine became an actress.
Are you the manager of this building?
Look at the italicized word in each sentence. Decide how it is used, then write subject, direct 
object, indirect object, or predicate noun in the blank.
	 1.	
 Claudia likes Bret.
	 2.	
 The boys found some money.
	 3.	
 The girls found some money.
	 4.

Definite and  
Indefinite Articles
The English definite article is the. It is used to identify a particular person or 
thing. If you are speaking about someone or something you are already familiar 
with, you use the with the noun. Look at these examples:
I already know the man.
She met the women who won the lottery.
This is the book that I told you about.
The indefinite article is used to describe someone or something that is unfamiliar 
to you or about which you are speaking in general. There are two forms: a and an. 
Use a before a word beginning with a consonant. Use an before a word beginning 
with a vowel. Look at these examples:
He sees a stranger on the corner.
Did you buy an apple or an orange?
Is the woman a good lawyer?
She has an idea.
Compare the difference between the definite and indefinite article by using these 
sentences: 
I want an apple. (I do not see an apple. But I feel hungry for one.)
I want the apple. (I am choosing between the apple and the orange that I see 
  before me.)
The definite article for plural nouns is also the. But there is no indefinite arti-
cle for plural nouns. The plural articles are used in the same way as the singular 
articles.

Adjectives	 11
Just like nouns, adjectives can follow the predicate. They most often come after forms of the verbs 
to be and to become:
My sister was very sad.
The horse suddenly became thirsty.
My grandfather is old.


	 2.	 The funny story is about a clown.

	 3.	 The careless waiter is out of work.

	 9.	 When can you come to our

	10.	 That is a

Adjectives
Adjectives describe or modify a noun or pronoun. They provide more information about a noun 
or pronoun, and they can provide additional meaning for a noun phrase.
Joseph is a famous guitar player.
The elderly couple slept at last.
The list of English adjectives is, of course, quite long. Here are some frequently used examples.
appropriate	
generous	
lonely	
Spanish
beautiful	
good	
modern	
spicy
bitter	
intelligent	
poor	
tall
brown	
lazy	
rich	
tasty
forgetful	
local	
scary	
vintage
An English adjective has only one form, whether the noun or pronoun it modifies is mascu-
line, feminine, or neuter, or singular or plural. This is true for predicate adjectives, as well as for 
adjectives that stand before a noun.
The new professor is quite intelligent.
Intelligent people don’t brag about their talents.
His youngest son is terribly lazy.
A lazy person probably won’t go far in life.
Even the baby giraffe is tall.
That tall girl is the star of her basketball team.

Using adjectives
Adjectives are words that modify nouns or pronouns. A variety of adjectival forms must be 
understood in order for you to write accurately. The most common type is the descriptive 
adjective.
Descriptive adjectives
Precisely as their name suggests, descriptive adjectives describe someone or something. The fol-
lowing list contains high-frequency descriptive adjectives. Consider what they tell about a noun 
they might modify.
beautiful	
funny	
kind	
short	
big	
handsome	
little	
soft	
blue	
happy	
red	
tall	
evil	
hard	
sad	
ugly	
The complete listing of all descriptive adjectives would be much longer. You can probably 
think of many other words that fit this category.
Predicative and attributive adjectives
Adjectives are used primarily in two different ways: predicatively and attributively. A predicate 
adjective is one that follows a linking verb and modifies a noun or pronoun “from a distance”—
that is, separated from the noun itself by the verb. 
subject + linking verb + predicate adjective
Mr. Price is handsome.
My vision seems blurred.
That really smells good!
It suddenly got cold.
Here are some commonly used linking verbs.
act	
fall	
look	
smell	
appear	
feel	
prove	
sound	
become	
get	
remain	
taste	
come	
grow	
seem	
Naturally, adjectives can be modified by any variety of adverbs. For example:
Mr. Price is very handsome.
Today the weather became quite terrible.
Attributive adjectives, on the other hand, stand before a noun. It is common to use more 
than one adjective to modify nouns in this position.
attributive adjective + subject + verb
The young officer came up to me.
The frightened young officer came up to me.
An old man sat down to rest.
A tired old man sat down to rest.
	
Adjectives	 15
You can view attributive adjectives as replacements for relative clauses that contain the 
­linking verb to be. Compare the following two sentences with the previous two examples:
The officer, who was frightened and young, came up to me.
A man, who was tired and old, sat down to rest.
Let’s look at an example of how a relative clause is changed to become an attributive adjec-
tive. Here’s the original sentence, with the relative clause set off by commas: 
The story, which is silly, amused the children.
To convert this sentence, the adjective silly is removed from the relative clause. The remaining 
words in the relative clause are omitted (as are the commas), and the adjective is placed before the 
noun. The result is a sentence with an attributive adjective, and that sentence conveys the same 
meaning as the sentence in which there was a relative clause:
The silly story amused the children.
When a noun follows a linking verb, it is called a predicate nominative. The predicate nomi-
native is a noun that further describes the subject of the sentence. Adjectives can modify the 
subject, the predicate nominative, or both. For example:
The winner was a man from Holland.
The eventual winner was a man from Holland.
The winner was an athletic man from Holland.
The eventual winner was an athletic man from Holland.
A sentence with a predicate nominative can be changed by reversing the positions of 
the subject and the predicate nominative and still make complete sense. This can occur only 
with linking verbs.
An athletic man from Holland was the eventual winner.
Some adjectives can be used only as predicate adjectives. They sound awkward if used attrib-
utively. Some of the most commonly used ones are these:
afraid	
glad	
safe
alive 	
ill	
sorry (meaning apologetic)
alone	
likely	
sure
apart	
ready	
unable
aware	
	
Let’s look at a couple of sentences illustrating correct versus incorrect usage:
The boy was quite alone.	
correct usage
The alone boy waited in the hall.	
incorrect usage
Certain other adjectives should be used only as attributive adjectives. If they are used as 
predicate adjectives, they should be followed by predicate nominatives.
atomic	 	
north/south
east/west	
northern/southern
eastern/western	
northern/western
indoor/outdoor	
supplementary
maximum	
woolen
nationwide

If indoor and outdoor are used predicatively, they take the adverbial form indoors and 
outdoors. If supplementary is used predicatively, its form changes to a noun: a supplement. In 
the case of woolen, when used predicatively, it becomes the phrase made of wool.
Let’s again look at a pair of sentences illustrating correct usage versus incorrect usage:
An occasional rain kept the streets 	
correct usage 
wet and slick.
The rain today was only occasional.

Adjectives	 17
Limiting adjectives
There are nine types of limiting adjectives: definite and indefinite articles, possessive adjectives, 
demonstrative adjectives, indefinite adjectives, interrogative adjectives, cardinal adjectives, ordi-
nal adjectives, proper adjectives, and nouns used as adjectives. The obvious function of any limit-
ing adjective is to limit or to specify some aspect of the noun it modifies.
Definite and indefinite articles 
The definite and indefinite articles illustrate this limitation function well. The definite article 
(the) specifies someone or something as already known or mentioned. Indefinite articles (a, an) 
identify an unknown person or thing and persons or things in general. For example:
The man on the corner is my friend.	
A specific man is the topic here. He is known  
	
	
	
to the speaker.
A man on the corner was hit by a car.	
An unspecified man is the topic here. He is  
	
	
	
unknown to the speaker.
The heavy suitcase belongs to Mary.	
A specific suitcase is the topic here. The  
	
	
	
speaker knows that it is heavy.
A heavy suitcase is not allowed.	
Heavy suitcases in general are the topic here.
Indefinite articles are not used with plural nouns. The complete omission of an article with 
a plural noun indicates that the meaning is indefinite. Compare the following pairs of 
sentences:
Singular	
Plural
The boy plays chess.	
The boys play chess.
A good student must behave.	
Good students must behave.
Possessive adjectives
Possessive adjectives limit the nouns they modify in terms of the ownership implied: my, your, 
his, her, its, our, and their. The possessive whose, which inquires into ownership, is also an inter-
rogative adjective but belongs in this group, as well.
My new car is a Ford.	
Ownership of the car is limited to me.
Her kitten became quite ill.	
Ownership of the kitten is limited to her.
Our garden did well this year.	
Ownership of the garden is limited to us.
Demonstrative adjectives
The demonstrative adjectives—this, that, these, and those—limit the modified noun to the one 
identified by the speaker: this one, that one. The demonstrative adjectives show closeness (this, 
these) or distance (that, those) in the same way as the demonstrative pronouns.
This book is hard to understand.
That remark was uncalled for.
These men need a job.
Do you know those people?

Indefinite adjectives
Indefinite adjectives provide general information about the nouns they modify. They often answer 
the questions how much? or how many? Among the most common indefinite adjectives are all, 
any, each, every, few, many, and some. Let’s look at some sentences that illustrate their use:
All work must be completed by noon.	
how much work?
Each candidate will have ten minutes 	
how many candidates? 
to speak.
Are some companies in financial trouble?	 how many companies?
Interrogative adjectives
The interrogative adjectives are what, which, and whose (as noted earlier, whose is also a posses-
sive adjective). They modify nouns in the same way as other limiting adjectives. What and which 
inquire into a choice between two persons or things and from among a group of persons or 
things. Whose asks about ownership. Here are some examples:
What airline are you taking to Brazil?
What cities do you want to visit?
What day will you arrive back in the States?
Which game do you like best?
Which candidate appeals to you more?
Which dessert did you order?
	
20	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
Whose limousine is parked in front of the house?
Whose husband is a famous rap star?
Whose cake won first prize at the fair?
Cardinal adjectives
Cardinal adjectives are simply numbers used as adjectives. They limit the nouns they modify by 
specifying an amount. That amount can be as little as “zero” or as great as any number you can 
conceive of. For example:
One boy scraped his knee on the ground.
Fifteen girls are in the contest.
Eighty dollars was too much for the blouse.
Notice that the subject of the last of these sentences is plural, but it is considered a single quantity 
and therefore takes a singular verb: Eighty dollars was . . . . Let’s consider the difference between 
the use of a singular verb and a plural verb with such quantities.
If there are eighty individual dollar bills on the floor, you can say: Eighty dollars are on the 
floor. If, instead, you wish to refer to the entire quantity of eighty dollars as a single sum of 
money, you can say: Eighty dollars is more than I want to spend.
Ordinal adjectives
Numbers are used in a slightly different adjectival form with ordinal adjectives. These adjectives 
limit the nouns they modify by specifying numerical order. For example:
The first question on the test was simple.
They’re celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary.
Jake is the twelfth boy in line.
The majority of ordinal adjectives are formed by adding -th to the end of a number: fourth, 
thirtieth, hundredth, and so on. There are only a few irregular forms, as follows:
Cardinal number	
Ordinal number
one	
first
two	
second
three	
third
five

Proper adjectives and nouns used as adjectives
Proper adjectives are words that are proper nouns but act as modifiers of other nouns. Since 
proper nouns are capitalized, capitalization is also required when they are used as adjectives. A 
large category of proper adjectives comprises words that come from country or language names 
and that can be used both attributively and predicatively. Here are some examples:
I love Italian food.
Is French champagne the best?
He said the American cars are less expensive.
I believe this drawing is Japanese.
The same need for capitalization applies to proper names; however, proper names tend to be 
used only attributively. For example:
We read a Shakespearean play.
The Hilton mansion is hidden by trees.
The Bush administration ended in 2009.
Isn’t that a Streisand song?
Many other nouns can also act as modifiers. If they are not proper nouns, they do not need 
to be capitalized and can be used only attributively. For example:
Several party gifts were identical.
The wedding guests were starting to get tipsy.
I think I lost my credit card.

Infinitives

­follows the noun or pronoun it modifies. For example:
This is always a fun show to watch.
We still haven’t found anyone to hire for this position.
Professor Keller’s class would be a great one to take.

Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. The English personal pronouns are:
	
Singular	
Plural
First Person	
I
we
Second Person	
you	
you
Third Person	
he, she, it	
they
Notice that you is both singular and plural. When speaking to one person, say 
you. When speaking to two or more persons, say you:
Tim, you are a very good student.
Bruno and Rene, you have to study more.
Just as nouns have gender, pronouns also do. I, we, and you can be used by males 
or females. He is always masculine, she is always feminine, and it is always neuter. 
The plural of the third-person pronouns is always they, whether masculine, femi-
nine, or neuter. And just like nouns, pronouns can be used as:
1.	 the subject of a sentence 
2.	 a direct object 
3.	 an indirect object
But when used as a direct object or indirect object, some of the pronouns 
change:
Subject	
Direct Object	
Indirect Object
I	
me	
me
you	
you 	
you
he	
him	
him
she	
her	
her
it	
it 	
it
we	
us	
us
you (plural)	
you	
you
they	
them

If a pronoun replaces a noun in the sentence, it must have the same characteris-
tics as the noun: the same number (singular or plural), the same gender (mascu-
line, feminine, or neuter), and the same use in the sentence (subject, direct

object, or indirect object). Look at these examples where the pronoun replaces the italicized 
noun:
Joseph is a hard worker.	
➞	
He is a hard worker.
(singular masculine noun/subject)	
	
(singular masculine pronoun/subject)
Do you know the girls?	
➞	
Do you know them?
(plural noun/direct object)	
	
(plural pronoun/direct object)
We gave Mrs. Jones some flowers.	
➞	
We gave her some flowers.
(singular feminine noun/	
	
(singular feminine pronoun/ 
indirect object)	
	
indirect object)
Notice that the nouns and pronouns are in the third person. This is true when a pronoun replaces 
a noun. But when a noun or pronoun is combined with the first-person singular pronoun I, it is 
replaced by the first-person plural pronoun we:
You and I have work to do. ➞ We have work to do.
He helps the girls and me. ➞ He helps us.

	 7.	 We sent them a box of candy. 
 
	 8.	 It costs twenty dollars. 
 
	 9.	 The boys watched her. 
 
	10.	 Do they understand us? 
 
When you change a direct object noun to a direct object pronoun, you must add to or for before 
the indirect object noun or pronoun. The indirect object becomes the object of the preposition to 
or for. Place the prepositional phrase after the direct object. For example:
I gave Jay a book. ➞ I gave it to Jay.
We buy her flowers. ➞ We buy them for her.

	 4.	 I ­didn’t buy Ella the scarf.

Nouns or pronouns can be used to complete a prepositional phrase. That is a phrase made up of a 
preposition and a noun or a pronoun. Here are some of the most commonly used prepositions:
after, behind, between, for, from, in, near, on, of, through, to, with, without
Look at these sample prepositional phrases:

behind me
between the girls	
for you
from a friend	
in him
near the city

of a book	
	
through her
to a student

object:

Pronouns as the subject of a sentence
The first person pronouns refer to one’s self. The second person pronouns refer to others to whom 
you are speaking. And the third person pronouns are substitutes for all other nouns. The pro-
nouns that can act as the subject of a sentence (and are for this reason called subject, or personal, 
pronouns) are listed in the chart ­below.
	
Singular	
Plural
First ­Person	
I	
we
Second ­Person	
you	
you
Third Person	
he, she, ­it

Note that you has both a singular and plural meaning: “Mary, you are a great athlete.” “Tom and 
Mary, you have to study ­more.”

In addition, there are two more pronouns that are used to ask questions about people (who) 
and about things ­(what).
The pronoun he can replace nouns that refer to ­males:
the man ➞ he
a boy ➞ he
the doctor ➞ he
The pronoun she can replace nouns that refer to ­females:
the woman ➞ she
a girl ➞ she
the doctor ➞ she
The pronoun it can replace nouns that refer to ­objects:
the rock ➞ it
a building ➞ it
his nose ➞ it
The pronoun they can replace nouns that refer to ­plurals:
the girls ➞ they
men ➞ they
two rocks ➞ they
The pronoun who can replace animate nouns to form a ­question:
The man became ill. ➞ Who became ill?
A few women went shopping. ➞ Who went ­shopping?
The pronoun what can replace inanimate nouns to form a ­question:
Our house burned down. ➞ What burned ­down?
His tools are in the garage. ➞ What is in the ­garage?
There is one notable exception to the rule that pronouns are derived by the gender of nouns. It is 
common to refer to a boat or sometimes an automobile as a ­female:
“What a beautiful sailboat! She’s a real ­beauty.”
“What about the Titanic?” “She sank in the Atlantic in ­1912.”
“She’s been a good old car, but it’s time to trade her in.”
Note that a noun or pronoun combined with I can be replaced by we:
you and I = we
she and I = we
the boy and I = we
the girls and I = we
The subject pronouns determine the form of the verb in the sentence. In the present tense most 
verbs require an -s ending when the subject is a third person singular pronoun or noun: he has, 
	
Personal Pronouns	 31
the girl sings. The other pronouns do not require an ending on the verb. The only exception to this 
is the verb to be, which has a more complicated conjugation than other ­verbs:
	
to come	
to help	
to be
I	
come	
help	
am
you	
come	
help	
are
he, she, ­it	
comes	
helps	
is
we	
come	
help	
are
you	
come	
help	
are
they	
come	
help	
are
In the past tense the subject pronouns do not require an additional ending on the verb beyond the 
past tense formation. There is only one exception to this rule, and, again, it is the verb to be. Look 
at these examples in the past ­tense:
	
to come	
to help	
to be
I	
came	
helped	
was
you	
came	
helped	
were
he, she, ­it	
came	
helped	
was
we	
came	
helped	
were
you	
came	
helped	
were
they	
came	
helped	
were
There is another second person singular pronoun. It is thou. It is considered archaic and is only 
found in very old documents or literature and in certain versions of the Bible. Its forms are:
Subject pronoun: thou
Object pronoun: thee
Possessive pronouns: thy, ­thine
As the subject of a present tense sentence, thou requires an -st ending on the verb: thou hast, thou 
canst. You should be aware of this pronoun’s existence, but it will not be considered further in this 
­book.

Personal Pronouns	 33
There is one special contraction formed from the words let us: ­let’s.
Other contractions are a combination of a verb and the negative word not:

Pronouns in a contraction should only be used in complete utterances and not in an elliptical 
phrase (a phrase in which information is ­understood):
He’ll arrive here on the five-thirty bus.
I’m sure tomorrow will be a better day for you.
But it is common to respond to someone’s question with an elliptical phrase. An elliptical phrase 
is one that leaves out certain words that are understood from the words in the question. In ellipti-
cal phrases contractions should not be used, unless the contraction is the combination of a verb 
and the negative word not. Let’s look at some ­examples:
Question: Is he going to work ­today?
Answer: Yes, he’s going to work ­today.
Elliptical answer: Yes, he is. (no ­contraction)
Question: Are you afraid of ­mice?
Answer: Yes, I’m afraid of ­mice.
Elliptical answer: Yes, I am. (no ­contraction)
Question: Did she have enough ­money?
Answer: No, she ­didn’t have enough ­money.
Elliptical answer: No, she ­didn’t. (combination of a verb and not)

Pronouns as direct objects
Although nouns do not change when they are used as direct objects in a sentence, most pronouns do.
Subject	
Direct ­Object
I
me
you (singular)
you ­(singular)
he, she, it	
him, her, ­it
we	
us
you (plural)	
you ­(plural)
they	
them
who	
whom
what	
what
You should be aware that in casual language, most people substitute who for whom as the direct 
object ­form.
Now look at the pronouns when they are used as direct objects in a ­sentence:
Bill saw me at the bank ­yesterday.
I like you a lot. (singular you)
Mom sent her to the ­store.
We bought it a week ago.
She found us hiding in the ­garage.
I’ll help you. (plural you)
Michael warned them about the ­danger.
Whom did you meet at the party? (or, in casual language, Who did you meet at the ­party?)
What are they making for ­supper?
	
Personal Pronouns	 35
Look at these examples that show what occurs when direct object nouns are changed to direct 
object ­pronouns:
Jim tried to kiss the girl. ➞ Jim tried to kiss her.
They really like their former coach. ➞ They really like him.
Who threw the ball to him? ➞ Who threw it to him?
You’ll find the new tools in the shed. ➞ You’ll find them in the ­shed.

Pronouns as indirect objects
Nouns used as indirect objects look the same as when they are used as subjects or direct objects. 
Look at these examples with the phrase the man.
Subject: The man is a stranger to me.
Direct object: Do you know the man?
Indirect object: I gave the man a few ­dollars.
But pronouns change. Pronouns used as indirect objects have the same form as pronouns used as 
direct ­objects.

Pronouns in a prepositional phrase
Nouns do not change their form when used in a prepositional phrase. But pronouns do, and they 
take the same form they do as direct or indirect ­objects.
Form of Pronouns That Follow ­Prepositions

you (singular)

I took a picture of him.
What do you know about her?
There’s something hiding in it.

Personal Pronouns	 39
Direct and indirect object pronouns in  
the same sentence
When a direct object and an indirect object are used in the same sentence and both are nouns, the 
indirect object (IO) always precedes the direct object ­(DO).
Father showed Mr. Garcia (IO) his new car ­(DO).
Will you give the dogs (IO) some water ­(DO)?
If only the indirect object is changed to a pronoun, the same word order ­occurs:
Father showed him (IO) his new car ­(DO).
Will you give them (IO) some water ­(DO)?
But if the direct object is changed to a pronoun, there is a significant change in the word order 
and the indirect object becomes the object of the preposition to or for. This occurs whether the 
indirect object is a noun or a pronoun. Look at these ­examples:
Direct Object as Noun	
Direct Object as ­Pronoun
I sent the men some 	
I sent it to the men. 
fresh coffee.

A Word of Caution
You will sometimes hear native speakers use pronouns incorrectly. 
This is particularly true when two pronouns are used together or a 
noun and a pronoun are used together—for example, you and I, Tom 
and he.
You have seen examples in this book that show which pronouns are 
used as the subject of a sentence. But compare what is correct with 
what you might hear a native say:
Correct: Tom and she are playing baseball ­tomorrow.
Incorrect: Tom and her are playing baseball ­tomorrow.
Correct: He and I have the same ­birthday.
Incorrect: Him and me have the same ­birthday.
Similar errors occur when such phrases are used as a direct or ­indirect 
object or the object of a preposition. In order to sound loftier, some 
speakers “overcorrect” the pronoun and use a nominative case 
­pronoun where an objective case pronoun is really required. This 
seems most prevalent with the first person singular pronoun I:
Correct: Martha gave Barbara and me a list of ­chores.
Incorrect: Martha gave Barbara and I a list of ­chores.
Correct: Did he want to speak with both you and me?
Incorrect: Did he want to speak with both you and ­I?
	
Personal Pronouns	 43
Demonstrative ­pronouns
It is easy to identify a demonstrative pronoun. It is a pronoun that points out the noun that is 
being spoken or written about. It modifies the noun like an adjective. The four demonstrative 
pronouns are this, that, these, and ­those.
This and these indicate something that is close by. This is used with singular nouns, and these is 
used with plural ­nouns:
This man is a good friend of mine. (The man is ­here.)
These books are on sale now. (The books are ­here.)
That and those indicate something that is far away. That is used with singular nouns, and those is 
used with plural ­nouns:
That woman is my teacher. (I see the woman in the ­distance.)
Did you see those airplanes? (Did you see the airplanes in the ­distance?)

Like any other pronoun, an indefinite pronoun replaces a noun, but it is usually a noun that has 
appeared earlier in an utterance. Look at these ­examples:
The children were in an accident. But all are safe and sound now.
Were the robbers finally caught? Only some of ­them.
Mary and Barbara were born on the same day. Yes, but each has a separate birthday ­party.
You need to be aware that a few of the indefinite pronouns can be used as a singular or plural: all, 
any, more, most, none, and some. Here are a few ­examples:
Singular	
Plural
All is well.	
All speak English and ­Spanish.
Most was done by John.	
Most aren’t going to vote for him.
Some was left on the table.	
Some think she’s very ­beautiful.

Exercise
Circle the indefinite pronoun that best completes each ­sentence.

	 2.	 I bought seven tickets. All/Something/Neither were purchased at a ­discount.
	 3.	 The children ­didn’t like her, and most/none/any would play with her.
	 4.	 Nobody/Other/Either put in enough time on the ­project.
	 5.	 Someone/Many/Everything he said turned out to be a lie.
	 6.	 Many of them enjoyed the concert. Others/Each/Another went home ­early.
	 7.	 They invited a hundred guests. Much/Several/Anybody are already in the reception ­hall.
	 8.	 The two girls took part in the competition, but any/somebody/neither had a chance of 
­winning.
	 9.	 Anyone/Another/Few found without proper identification will be ­arrested.
	10.	 Many/Anything/Much has been said about the problem, but nothing has been ­done.
Interrogative ­pronouns
The interrogative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and what. They are called interrogative 
because they ask a question. And like other pronouns, they replace ­nouns.
Who invited these people to the party? (Tom invited these ­people.)
Whom can I rely upon in these difficult times? (I can rely upon ­Tom.)
Whose was voted the best cake at the fair? (Tom’s cake was voted ­best.)
Which is the hat you decided to buy? (I decided to buy that gray ­hat.)
What is he talking about? (He is talking about the theory of ­relativity.)
These pronouns can be separated into nominative, objective, and possessive ­forms:
Nominative	
Objective	
Possessive
who	
whom	
whose
which	
which
what	
what
	
Personal Pronouns	 45
The nominative is used as the subject of a sentence. The objective is used as the direct object, 
indirect object, or object of a preposition. The possessive form shows ownership. Look at these 
examples with who and ­which:
Nominative: Who rented your ­apartment?
Objective: Whom will they elect as ­president?
Possessive: Whose is the brightest ­child?
Nominative: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Objective: Which do you want to ­sell?
Just like indefinite pronouns, interrogative pronouns are used when the noun in question is 
­understood.

Numbers as pronouns
If a pronoun is a word that replaces a noun, then a number that does the same thing can be con-
sidered a pronoun. If the number stands alone, it is no longer just a numerical value or an adjec-
tive modifying a noun. It functions as a pronoun. Look at some ­examples:
Number Modifying 	
Number Used  
a Noun	
as a ­Pronoun

One felt sad but would not cry.

minutes ­apart.
Ten soldiers watched the 	
Ten fled the battlefield in  
enemy approach.	
­fear.
Just like indefinite pronouns, numbers are used as pronouns when the noun in question is 
­understood.
Numbers as Nouns
Careful! A number can also act as a noun. When it is a noun, the verb 
used is singular. When it is a pronoun, the verb is plural (except with 
­one):
Noun: Thirteen is an unlucky ­number.
Pronoun: Thirteen are hiding in the ­brush.
Noun: One is pronounced like the word won.
Pronoun: One is still in the ­nest.

	 6.	 The new sales clerk sold her eight beautiful ­skirts.
	 7.	 Three people applied for the same job.
	 8.	 There were at least fifty pennies scattered about the ­floor.
The Pronoun one
Many people use the pronoun one in a more traditional or formal style. But it can be replaced by 
you in casual speech. Either pronoun—one or you—is used when someone does not want to use 
a pronoun that identifies a specific person; they are used to speak in general. If you substitute the 
pronoun someone for one, you will have the approximate meaning of one. Like other pronouns, 
one and you have four ­functions:
Nominative	
Objective	
Possessive	
Reflexive
one	
one	
one’s	
oneself
you	
you	
your	
yourself
(The reflexive will be taken up separately in Unit 11.)
Look how they are used in ­sentences:
Formal: If one believes in ghosts, one might be considered ­superstitious.
Approximate meaning: If someone believes in ghosts, someone might be considered ­superstitious.
Casual: If you believe in ghosts, you might be considered ­superstitious.
One is a third person pronoun and, therefore, verbs used with this pronoun require the same end-
ing as any other third person pronoun: he talks, one talks; she goes, one goes; it is, one is. But if you 
replaces one, the ending -s is not required in the present ­tense.
Formal: If one plays fairly, one always ­wins.
Casual: If you play fairly, you always win.
Do not confuse this special use of you with the second person pronoun you. They can be used in 
identical sentences, but the meaning of each sentence is ­different.
Second person pronoun: John, you should always wash your ­hands.
Replacement for third person pronoun one: You should always wash your hands. (One should 
always wash one’s hands. Someone should always wash his ­hands.)

Using pronouns in sentences
In the category of pronouns, people tend to be most familiar with personal pronouns, since these 
parts of speech are widely used in the English language. Other types of pronouns also exist, how-
ever, and they must be identified and practiced in order for you to be able to use them well in 
sentence writing. This chapter addresses the following types of pronouns: personal pronouns, 
relative pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, reflexive pronouns, indefinite pronouns, reciprocal 
pronouns, and intensive pronouns.
All pronouns are used as a replacement for a form of a noun. For example:
	 Pronoun as a subject
the man is → he is
	 Pronoun as an object
we saw the man → we saw him
	 Possessive pronoun
the man’s → his

Personal pronouns
The personal pronouns have a subjective form, an objective from, and a possessive form. The sub-
jective form is used in place of a noun subject of a sentence. The objective form is used in place of a 
noun serving as either a direct object, an indirect object, or the object of a preposition. The posses-
sive form replaces a possessive noun formed with an apostrophe plus s (for example, Bill’s) or in a 
prepositional phrase introduced by of (for example, of Bill). The personal pronouns are as follows:
Subjective	
Objective	
Possessive
I	 	
me	
my/mine
you	
you	
your/yours 
he		
him	
his/his
she	
her 	
her/hers
it	 	
it	
its/its
we	
us	
our/ours
they	
them	
their/theirs
who	
whom	
whose/whose
what 	
what	
whose/whose
When a possessive modifies a noun, the first possessive form in the preceding list of pairs is used:
My car is new.
Her books were on the floor.
Their tent blew over in the wind.
When the possessive is used in place of the possessive word and the noun it modifies, 
the noun is omitted, and the second form of the pairs is used.
Mine is new.
Hers were on the floor.
Theirs blew over in the wind.
It is only the third-person pronouns (he, she, it, they, who, and what) that are substitu-
tions for a noun. He, she, and it replace singular nouns.
The doctor is young.	
He is young.
Their daughter was ill.	
She was ill.
Jim opened the cage.	
He opened it.
They replaces plural nouns—both animate and inanimate.
Are the boys home?	
Are they home?
Did you meet our visitors?	
Did you meet them?
Both who and what are used in questions.
Jack broke his arm.	
Who broke his arm?
The dog ate the pie.	
What did the dog eat?
The first- and second-person pronouns (I, you, we) are not replacements for nouns but rather 
function on their own. However, I can be combined with nouns or other pronouns, and that 
combination can be replaced by a form of we. For example:
Jane and I live on the same street.	
We live on the same street.
The girls saw Tom and me.	
The girls saw us.
You and I will always be friends.	
We will always be friends.
She and I started a club.	
We started a club.

EXERCISE
A pronoun serves as the subject in each of the following sentences. Using that pronoun as your 
cue, write one sentence with that pronoun serving as a direct or indirect object; write a second 
sentence using the pronoun as the object of a preposition; and write a third sentence using the 
pronoun as a possessive. Link the content of each sentence so that you create a simple story line.
Example:	
She developed a friendship with John.
	
	
Did John take her out on a date?
	
	
Not really, but John spoke with her every day.
	
	
Her father never really grew to like John.

Relative pronouns 
Relative pronouns are used to combine two sentences that contain identical nouns or pronouns. 
The sentence in which the noun is replaced by a relative pronoun becomes a subordinating clause. 
As such, that clause cannot stand alone; it functions as part of the main clause. The person and 
number of the antecedent of the relative pronoun will determine the person and number of the 
relative pronoun.
person and number of antecedent → person and number of relative pronoun
The English relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, that, and an elliptical form, 
in which the relative pronoun is omitted but understood. The forms of who and which are used 
to introduce a nonrestrictive relative clause—that is, a clause that gives parenthetical information. 
Nonrestrictive relative clauses are set off from the rest of the sentence by commas. That intro-
duces a restrictive relative clause—that is, a clause that defines the antecedent in the main clause. 
Let’s look at some example sentences:
	 Nonrestrictive relative clauses
He met the mayor, who was elected in a landslide.
The primary information is that he met the mayor. The writer of this sentence is giving 
incidental information (the mayor was elected in a landslide) that is not necessarily perti-
nent to the fact that he met the mayor.
She approached the officer, whom her brother knew from college.
The primary information is that she approached the officer. The writer of this sentence is 
giving incidental information (her brother knew the officer from college) that is not neces-
sarily pertinent to the fact that she approached the officer.
I opened the ledger, which had two large ink stains on it.
The primary information is that I opened the ledger. The writer of this sentence is giving 
incidental information (the ledger had two large ink stains on it) that is not necessarily 
pertinent to the fact that I opened the ledger.
The relative clauses just illustrated merely provide parenthetical information; the 
information is not necessary for the meaning of the main clause. Those clauses could be 
omitted, because they do not enhance the meaning of the main clause:
He met the mayor.
She approached the officer.
I opened the ledger.
	 Restrictive relative clauses
He met the mayor that was accused of unethical practices.
	
Personal Pronouns	 53
He didn’t meet just any mayor. The relative clause explains more about its antecedent: this 
mayor was accused of unethical practices.
She approached the officer that had given her a ticket.
She didn’t approach just any officer. The relative clause explains more about its anteced-
ent: this officer had given her a ticket.
I opened the ledger that was hidden in the back of my boss’s closet.
I didn’t open just any ledger. The relative clause explains more about its antecedent: this 
ledger was hidden in the back of my boss’s closet.
When writing sentences with relative clauses in them, it is necessary to choose 
the appropriate relative pronoun. If you wish to make a parenthetical statement, 
choose a nonrestrictive relative pronoun. If you wish to add information that 
explains the antecedent in the main clause, choose a restrictive relative pronoun. 
For example:
David danced with the woman, who has a summer house on the shore.
David danced with the woman that had been flirting with him.
David danced with the woman who had been flirting with him.
Be aware that who can function as a restrictive relative pronoun and can replace that.
	 Elliptical relative pronouns
I found the little ashtray (that) you made in junior high school.
We finally arrived at the corner (that) John had been waiting on for hours.
Here’s the jacket (that) I bought yesterday.
Notice that the word that can be omitted in these clauses only when they are used as 
objects. When that is used as the subject of the clause, it must be retained.
Here’s the jacket that was made in France.	
subject
Have you met our new neighbors that live on Hyde Street?	
subject
An elliptical relative pronoun can be derived from a clause containing either that or which. 
However, when the relative pronoun is omitted, the tone of the clause becomes restrictive.
Here’s the jacket, which I bought yesterday.	
→ Here’s the jacket I bought yesterday.
Here’s the jacket that I bought yesterday.	
→ Here’s the jacket I bought yesterday.
It is correct to use whose to refer to either an animate or an inanimate antecedent. With 
inanimate antecedents, the prepositional phrase of which can replace whose. For example:
	 Animate antecedents
Tim liked the girl, whose eyes were following him wherever he went.
Have you interviewed the man whose house burned down?
	 Inanimate antecedents
She bought a sweater, whose dark color didn’t flatter her.
She bought a sweater, the dark color of which didn’t flatter her.
The judge studied the document, whose content was extremely vague.
The judge studied the document, the content of which was extremely vague.

Prepositions in relative clauses require a special look. Their position is not static; they can 
occupy two different places in the clause. In formal style, the preposition precedes a nonrestric-
tive relative pronoun. For example:
The lawyer, from whom he received the information, is under investigation.
I cannot explain the circumstances under which she gradually lost her wealth.
They innocently hiked toward the woods in which cannibals were said to dwell.
In a less formal style, the preposition can be placed at the end of the clause:
The lawyer, whom he received the information from, is under investigation.
In a still less formal style, the correct use of whom is avoided:
The lawyer, who he received the information from, is under investigation.
When that and who(m) are used as restrictive relative pronouns, prepositions always appear 
at the end of the relative clause. This is also true with elliptical relative pronouns.
The dress that she slipped into was much too big for her.
The dress she slipped into was much too big for her.
That’s the old man whom Thomas works for.
That’s the old man Thomas works for.

Demonstrative pronouns
The singular demonstrative pronouns are this and that. This refers to someone or something 
nearby or part of the present topic of conversation. That points to someone or something in the 
distance or referred to in the past. Their plural forms are these and those and refer, respectively, 
to something nearby or in the distance. These pronouns also function as adjectives.
located nearby + this/these
located in the distance + that/those
This fellow is in a lot of trouble.	
He is nearby. We’re talking about him now.
That fellow was rather arrogant.	
He is in the distance. We talked about him earlier.
These people are friends of mine.	
They are nearby. We’re talking about them now.
Those people work for Mr. Paine.	
They are in the distance. We talked about  
	
	
them earlier.
When these pronouns are not accompanied by a noun, they function as pronouns rather 
than as adjectives, but their meaning of closeness or distance from a person or thing is 
maintained.
This is the one I want.
That was the last one.
I borrowed these from Jim.
Were those once a different color?
As is true of other pronouns, demonstrative pronouns can be subjects or objects. To indicate 
a possessive, a demonstrative pronoun becomes the object of the preposition of. Here are 
examples:
This really wasn’t necessary.	
subject
Did you buy those in Mexico?	
object
We spoke about that a moment ago.	
object of preposition
What is the meaning of this?	
possession with of

Reflexive pronouns
Reflexive pronouns are used only as objects and never as subjects of a sentence. They can be direct 
objects, indirect objects, or the objects of prepositions.
He cut himself shaving.	
direct object
He bought himself some new ties.	
indirect object
He was talking to himself.	
object of preposition
Compare the English personal pronouns with their reflexive-pronoun counterparts:

Reflexive pronouns
I	
myself
you	
yourself
he	
himself
she	
herself
it	
itself
we	
ourselves
you	
yourselves
they

When the subject and object are different persons or things, the object is a personal pro-
noun. For example:
The man asked her what happened.
We bought them some ice cream.
It is when the subject and object are the same person or thing that a reflexive pronoun is used.
The man asked himself what happened.
We bought ourselves some ice cream.

Personal Pronouns	 59
Indefinite pronouns
The indefinite pronouns have a unique function. They act in a sentence like other pronouns—that 
is, they are substitutions for nouns; however, the indefinite pronouns are not a replacement for a 
specific noun. Instead, they refer to anyone, everyone, or no one in particular. Here are some of the 
most commonly used indefinite pronouns that are always singular:
anyone/anybody	
neither
each		
no one/nobody
either	
one
everyone/everybody	
someone/somebody
much
Each pronoun in the four pairs of indefinite pronouns (anyone/anybody, everyone/every-
body, no one/nobody, someone/somebody) is identical in meaning to its companion 
pronoun.
Anyone can play this game.	
→ Anybody can play this game.
No one understands me.	
→ Nobody understands me.
Also, do not confuse the indefinite pronoun one (a number) with the personal pronoun 
one (a person).
Indefinite	
One of you will have to stay on duty tonight.
Personal	
One might at first assume that his theory  
	
	
	
is correct.
It’s important to recognize these pronouns as singular, because some of them are used with 
prepositional phrases that can contain a plural. This construction sometimes causes confusion 
and results in the use of a plural verb where a singular verb is needed.
Each of the dismissed employees receives a termination bonus.
Since each is a singular, the singular verb receives is needed in this sentence. The plural noun in 
the prepositional phrase of the dismissed employees is not the subject of the sentence.
Here is another example:
One of you has to take responsibility.
Since one is a singular, the singular verb has is needed in this sentence. The plural pronoun you 
is not the subject of the sentence.
Even when more than one person or thing is understood, these pronouns still always use 
only a singular verb. For example:
These two ties are the right price, but neither really appeals to me.
A few indefinite pronouns are plural, such as both, few, many, and several, and they require 
a plural verb when used as the subject of a sentence. For example:
Both of these women are candidates for mayor.
Few understand his motives.
Many of his opponents lie about his record.
There are also indefinite pronouns that are considered either singular or plural:
all	
most
any	
none
more	
some
	
60	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
The choice of a singular or plural verb with these indefinite pronouns depends on their 
usage in the sentence and on any accompanying prepositional phrase:
	 Singular
All is lost!
You can take the last piece of pie. More is coming.
Don’t eat the whole cake. Some is for Bill.
	 Plural
I met John’s fraternity brothers. Most are quite nice.
All of the children have had their inoculations.
There are several magazines on the floor, but none are mine.

	 7.	 no one  
 
	 8.	 few of them  
 
	 9.	 many  
 
	10.	 each of the contestants  
 
Reciprocal pronouns
There are only two reciprocal pronouns: one another and each other. Either one is correct, and 
each can replace the other in a sentence. They are used to combine two sentences that say that two 
persons or things are carrying out the same action. For example:
John loves Mary. Mary loves John.	
→ John and Mary love one another.
The dog glares at the cat. The cat glares 	
→ The dog and cat glare at each other. 
at the dog.
She kissed me. I kissed her.	
→ We kissed each other.
When pronouns are used in pairs of sentences as in the last example (She kissed me. I 
kissed her.), the pronoun I indicates that a second-person-plural pronoun (we) will be used with 
a reciprocal pronoun. If the pronoun is in the third person, a third-person-plural pronoun (they) 
will be used with a reciprocal pronoun.
He sees her. She sees him.	
→ They see one another.
	
Personal Pronouns	 61
Intensive pronouns
Intensive pronouns are often mistaken as reflexive pronouns because they look like reflexive 
pronouns.

she

Intensive pronouns function differently from reflexive pronouns. Their purpose is to empha-
size the subject of the sentence. Compare the following pairs of sentences, in which the subject is 
emphasized in the second pair.
I believe that war with them can be avoided.
I myself believe that war with them can be avoided.
You said that you could afford it.
You yourself said that you could afford it.

The present tense
The present tense has a diverse range of meanings. There are no fewer than seven dis-
tinct meanings for the present tense distributed across not only present time but also 
past and future time as well. Here is a brief summary of the seven different meanings 
divided into three groups—the first group dealing with present time, the second 
group dealing with past time, and the third group dealing with future time:
Present time
1.	 Makes assertions or generalizations about ongoing conditions or states
2.	 Describes existing habits or customs
3.	 Comments on present-time actions
Past time
4.	 Recounts ideas or information from the past that affects us in the present
5.	 Comments on or paraphrases the works of others
Future time
6.	 Refers to future events if those events are fixed or scheduled
7.	 Refers to future events in adverb clauses when the main clause uses will
We will now discuss the present, past, and future uses of the present tense in detail.
Using the present tense for present time
Not surprisingly, the most common use of the present tense is for the present period 
of time. It is critical to understand that there are two fundamentally different ways of 
conceptualizing what we mean by “present time”: (1) the present moment of time, or 
(2) a span or period of time that is not bound to the present moment of time; that is, 
the verb describes an ongoing “timeless” state or condition.
If we want to refer to the present moment of time, we do not use the present tense 
at all; instead, we use the present progressive. If we want to refer to a span or period of 
present time, we use the present tense.
Here is an example that shows the difference between the two tenses:
Present progressive	
Bill is walking the dog.
Present	
Bill walks to help control his blood  
	
	
  pressure.
	
64	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
The implication of the present progressive sentence is that Bill is out walking at this present 
moment of time. The present tense sentence does not tell us what Bill is doing at the moment. It 
tells us that Bill takes walks for his health, but it implies nothing about what Bill is doing at the 
present moment. In fact, Bill might not have walked for weeks.
5·1
EXERCISE
Each pair of sentences uses the same verb in its infinitive form (in parentheses). One of the 
sentences uses the verb to talk about an existing present condition; the other sentence uses 
the verb to talk about the present moment of time. Replace the verb in parentheses with the 
present tense if the verb is talking about an existing condition. Replace the verb in 
parentheses with the present perfect if the verb is talking about the present moment of time. 
The first is done as an example.

Verbs	 65
The present tense verbs that treat the present as a “timeless” span or period of time fall into 
two distinct categories: (1) verbs that make assertions or generalizations about ongoing condi-
tions or states and (2) verbs that describe habits or customs. We will discuss both ways of treating 
present time.
Assertions or generalizations about ongoing conditions or states. As noted in Chapter 1, 
verbs in English (and most other languages, for that matter) can be divided into two large fami-
lies: dynamic and stative; 99 percent of all verbs belong to the dynamic family. The traditional 
definition of verb (a word that shows action) refers exclusively to dynamic verbs. Dynamic verbs 
do things; for example: run, jump, sing, work, sleep.
Stative verbs, on the other hand, don’t really do anything. Instead, they describe conditions or 
states. While there are only a relative handful of stative verbs, they are among the most frequently 
used verbs. For example, be and have are stative verbs. Here are some examples:
Be  Mary is cold. 
Mary is a farmer.
Have  Mary has a little lamb. 
The lamb has a ribbon around its neck.
In these example sentences, the subjects (Mary and the lamb) are not doing anything. Rather, the 
stative verbs be and have are used to describe or tell us something about the subjects.
The reason why the distinction between dynamic and stative verbs is relevant to this discus-
sion is that the present tenses of all stative verbs make assertions or generalizations about pres-
ently existing conditions or states, and as such, they must be used in the present tense because 
that is what the function of the present tense is: to make assertions about ongoing conditions or 
states. In fact, if we try to use stative verbs in the present progressive, the result is predictably 
ungrammatical:
Be  X  Mary is being cold. 
X  Mary is being a farmer.
Have  X  Mary is having a little lamb. 
X  The lamb is having a ribbon around its neck.
The inherently different meanings of these two types of verbs cause them to interact very differ-
ently with the present tense. The timeless meaning of stative verbs is a perfect match with the timeless 
meaning of the present tense. Conversely, the time-bound meaning of dynamic verbs makes them 
incompatible with the basic “timeless” meaning of the present tense; for example, when we use the 
dynamic verb buy in the present, the result is ungrammatical:
X  John buys a truck.
As we will see, we can make this and other dynamic verbs grammatical in the present tense, but 
only if we use them in sentences that make “timeless” assertions or generalizations, or use the 
verbs to describe habitual or customary actions.
Most stative verbs can be grouped into the following six semantic categories (with 
examples):
Appearance: appear, be, look, seem
Cognition: believe, know, mean, think, understand
Emotions: appreciate, desire, dislike, doubt, hate, like, need, prefer, want, wish
Measurement: consist of, contain, cost, have, measure, weight
Sense: feel, hear, see, seem, smell, taste
Ownership: belong, have, own, possess
(Note: some verbs appear twice because they can be used with different meanings.)

EXERCISE
The underlined verbs in the following sentences are all in the present tense. The sentences 
that use stative verbs are grammatical; the sentences that use dynamic verbs are 
ungrammatical. In the space provided, write “OK” if the sentence is grammatical; write “Not 
OK” if the sentence is not grammatical. The first two sentences are done as examples.
I like how you have arranged your office.
Answer: 	
OK
We compare the results from the two samples.
Answer: 	
Not OK
	 1.	 I shake the tree to make the nuts fall off. 
	 2.	 I doubt that we can get to the meeting on time. 
	 3.	 The police identify the suspect. 
	 4.	 His proposal sounds pretty attractive to me. 
	 5.	 We arrange a meeting between the two groups. 
	 6.	 I gain two pounds over the holiday. 
	 7.	 We know what you mean. 
	 8.	 The whole project costs more than we can afford to pay. 
	 9.	 I fill the tank with gas. 
10.	 The results in the study closely resemble the result predicted in the model.  

11.	 When the water in the tank equals the water outside the tank, the gate will open.  

12.	 Their lawyer explains the problem. 
13.	 The job entails a great deal of travel. 
14.	 I watch TV. 
15.	 I hear what you are saying. 
Dynamic verbs can also be used in the present tense, but only if one of the following two 
conditions on the meaning of the sentence are met: (1) the sentence makes an assertion or gener-
alization about existing conditions or states, or (2) the sentence describes existing habits or cus-
toms. Let us take these conditions in order:
The assertions/generalizations can be of an objective, scientific nature; for example:
The planets revolve around the sun.
Fresh water floats on top of sea water.
They can be publicly verifiable; for example:
The semesters at our school last 15 weeks.
He gives private piano lessons.
	
Verbs	 67
They can be totally subjective personal opinions; for example:
Kids today spend too much time playing computer games.
Greenhouse gases cause global warming.
Cable TV costs too much.
Notice that none of these examples of dynamic verbs is tied to a specific moment in time. All 
are essentially “timeless” generalizations.
Existing habits or customs. Here are some examples of verbs in this category:
I always take my lunch to work.
We go to the movies every chance we get.
She normally checks her messages first thing in the morning.
The westbound train stops here only in the morning.
The kids usually do their homework right after school.
Verbs in this category describe a behavior that is typical or normal. It does not mean that the 
action is being performed at the present moment. For example:
We usually eat dinner at my mother’s house on Sunday.
This sentence does not mean that we are eating at my mother’s house now. In fact, the sentence 
would still be a valid statement if we haven’t seen my mother in a month.
One of the characteristics of this use of the present tense is that the sentence typically contains 
an adverb of frequency such as usually, always, every day, normally, or every weekend.

EXERCISE
All of the following sentences use the present tense of dynamic verbs, some sentences 
correctly, some incorrectly. If the sentence is grammatical, write “OK” in the space provided 
and then give the reason that justifies using the present tense. Use either “assertion” or 
“habitual.” If the use of the present tense is ungrammatical, write “Not OK.” The first three 
sentences are done as examples.
We usually start around 8:00.
Answer: 	
OK habitual


	 9.	 The company publishes my first book.

10.	 Ravens and crows recognize people they have seen before.

Finally, there is a third use of the present tense that refers to present time. However, this use 
is completely different from the first two because this third use actually does refer to the present 
moment of time (unlike the other two already discussed). We can use the present tense to com-
ment on or describe an ongoing present time action. Obviously, the situations in which we would 
use the present tense in this manner are highly restricted. The most common situations are sports 
events, demonstrations, and speech act commentaries. Here are some examples of each type:
Sports event	
Here comes the pitch. Johnston swings and misses.
	
	
Rodriguez is tripped in midfield. The referee blows his whistle and 
gives a yellow card to the defender.
Demonstration	
Next, I add a cup of flour and stir in thoroughly.
	
	
Finally, I close all open windows and reboot the computer.
Speech act commentary	
I hereby resign from the council.
	
	
We accept your offer.
We have now identified three different ways present tense verbs refer to present time:
	 By making assertions or generalizations about ongoing conditions or states
	 By describing presently existing habits or customs
	 By commenting on present-time ongoing actions

Using the present tense for past time
We use the present tense for referring to the past in two ways: (1) recounting ideas or information 
from the past that affects us in the present, and (2) commenting on or paraphrasing the works of 
others.
Recounting ideas or information from the past that affects us 
in the present
Normally, when we talk or write about specific events, we do so in the past tense. For example, 
virtually all novels and short stories are written in the past tense. As we will see in the next sec-
	
70	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
tion of this chapter, the basic meaning of the past tense is that the action described in the past 
tense is finished—over and done with.
But what if we want to talk about something that happened in the past that directly affects 
us in the present moment of time? Suppose, for example, that you heard on the evening news that 
a bad storm was predicted for your area. You could tell other people about the threatening weather 
in either the past tense or the present tense:
Past tense	
The evening news said that a big storm was coming.
Present tense	
The evening news says that a big storm is coming.
There is no real difference in meaning, but there is a difference in emphasis: the present tense ver-
sion is much more immediate and urgent.
Even where there is no sense of urgency, the present tense still implies that the information 
is new and immediate. For example, compare the following sentences:
Past tense	
I heard that you might be moving.
Present tense	
I hear that you might be moving.
The use of the present tense suggests that the information is new and relevant to the speaker.
We often use the present tense in discussing older material to emphasize that the content is 
still relevant to us in the present time. Here are some examples:
St. Paul says, “If I have not charity I am nothing.”
Darwin emphasizes that the world is not a static place.
Shakespeare says that all the world is a stage.
Commenting on or paraphrasing the works of others
When we write about the works of others, we often write in the present tense. Reviews of books, 
plays, movies, and TV programs are typically written in the present tense. For example, here is a 
brief summary of The Milagro Beanfield War. Notice that all of the verbs are in the present tense.
This 1988 fable about community solidarity takes place in the small town of Milagro, New Mexico 
(population 426). The movie revolves around the attempt by a large corporation to buy enough 
land in this small town to develop a tourist resort. The main obstacle is Joe Mondragon. Joe takes 
water that runs by his land to irrigate a field of beans that he plants. Technically, the water is 
reserved for the corporation, setting in motion a conflict over water rights between the local resi-
dents and the corporation. Colorful local characters and beautiful New Mexico scenery along 
with an intelligent, good-natured script make this a highly successful film.
Reports and summaries are usually written in the present tense. For example, here is a 
summary of a company’s leave policy:
Our current leave policy makes no distinction between vacation leave, sick leave, or personal time. 
All employees have a base of two weeks leave in their first year with the company. For each subse-
quent year of continuous employment, employees gain an additional day of leave. The maximum 
amount of leave that can be accumulated is three weeks per year.
Using the present tense for future time
There are two different grammatical constructions in which the present tense is used to refer to 
future time: one in main clauses and one in dependent adverb clauses.
In main clauses, we use the present tense to refer to future events if those events are already 
fixed or scheduled; for example:
	
Verbs	 71
The full moon occurs Wednesday night.
The train departs at 11:35.
Tomorrow’s New York Times covers the Senate race in California.
Next Tuesday is the twenty-third.
I see the dentist tomorrow at 11:00.
There is a colloquial extension of the use of the present tense for proposing a course of 
action; for example: “OK, here’s the plan. I pick up Mary at work, you get the car, and we all meet 
at the restaurant.” In effect, this is a tentative proposal for a schedule of future activities.
We use the present tense for asking questions about predictable future events; for example:
When does the movie start?
When is the tide full?
What day of the week is Christmas this year?
When does the kids’ summer program begin?
We would not use the present tense for future events that are less than certain; for example:
X  It rains tomorrow.
X  I believe that Italy wins the World Cup.
X  Our CEO thinks that we get the contract.

EXERCISE
In all of the following sentences, the present tense is used to refer to the future. If the usage is 
appropriate, write “OK.” If the usage is not appropriate, write “Not OK.” The first two 
sentences are done as examples.

	 8.	 When is the game?

	 9.	 Mrs. Brown returns on Monday.

10.	 They meet in Los Angeles next week, I believe.

The other use of the present tense for future time is in adverb clauses when the main clause 
uses will to talk about future time; for example:
A neighbor will look after our cat, while we are away.
main clause	
      adverb clause
I will call you if I hear anything.
main clause  adverb clause
They will start work as soon as they get the necessary permits.
main clause                  adverb clause
They won’t win the war even if they win this battle.
main clause                    adverb clause
In all these examples it is very easy to see that the verb in the present tense form is referring to the 
future just as much as the verb in the main clause that uses will.
One of the characteristics of adverb clauses is that they are easily moved in front of the main 
clause. As a result, the present tense used for future time can come before the main clause with 
will; for example:
While we are away, a neighbor will look after our cat.
adverb clause	
  main clause
If I hear anything, I will call you.

As soon as they get the necessary permits, they will start work.

            main clause
Even if they win this battle, they won’t win the war.

Note that when an adverb clause is moved from its normal position following the main 
clause and placed in front of the main clause, the adverb clause is set off from the main 
clause by a comma. This use of the comma is obligatory.

Verbs	 75
The past tense
The main use of the past tense is for events, conditions, or states that once existed in or during 
some past time but that do not exist in the present. There are two other non-past-time uses for the 
past tense: (1) hypothetical statements and (2) polite questions and deferential requests.
Using the past tense for past time
The past tense is used for events, conditions, or states that are now over and done with. So, for 
example:
Samantha went to school at Berkeley.
This sentence not only tells us where Samantha went to school but also tells us that Samantha is 
no longer going to school there.
The past tense is quite broad in the sense that it can refer to variety of past-time uses; for 
example:
A single point of past time
The power went out at 7:15 this morning.
I picked up the kids after school.
A span of time
I worked in that office from 2001 to 2006.
The most recent ice age lasted for about 13,000 years.
Habitual or repeated events
We always got the New York Times when we lived in the city.
They went to the same hotel every anniversary.
States or conditions that existed at some past time
Jason always admired his father’s achievements.
I hated having to take piano lessons when I was in grade school.
In all these different uses of the past tense, there is always the implication that it is no longer true 
today. Even ongoing states and conditions are tied (and limited) to the past. For example:
The children loved being read to at bedtime.
This sentence implies that the children are no longer being read to: either they have outgrown 
being read to or for some other reason no one reads to them anymore.
Other uses of the past tense
There are two other uses of the past tense:
	 Hypothetical statements
	 Polite questions and deferential requests
We will discuss these two uses of the past tense in turn.
Hypothetical statements
The past tense in modern English has inherited some of the functions of the subjective mood that 
existed in older forms of the language. One of these functions is making statements that are 
hypothetical or even contrary to fact. Needless to say, the past tense form in this subjunctive use 
does not mean past time; quite the contrary: this use of the subjunctive is often used to talk about 
the present or future (but in a tentative, hypothetical way).
	
76	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
The most distinctive use of the past tense for hypothetical statements is seen in construc-
tions that preserve the historical subjunctive use of were instead of the expected was. Here are 
some examples:
If I were you, I would try harder.
I wish I were feeling better.
It’s not as though he were guilty of a crime.
Suppose we were to quit our jobs.
If clauses have an unusual feature: all the verbs in the main clause that accompany the adver-
bial if clause must also be in the past tense. Here is an example of an if clause with multiple verbs 
in the main clause:
If I were you, I would be careful of what I said.
      main clause
Both verbs in the main clause, would and said, are in the past tense. In fact, if the verbs in the 
main clause were in the present or future tense, the sentence would become ungrammatical:
Present tense	
X  If I were you, I am careful of what I say.
Future tense	
X  If I were you, I will be careful of what I will say.
This is the only instance in English in which the subordinate clause controls the verb tense of the 
main clause.


4.	 I will be worried about where I park my car.

5.	 I will start working only when I have enough light to see what I am doing.

	
Verbs	 77
Polite questions and deferential requests
The past tense also inherits another feature of the subjunctive: deference or polite indirectness. 
This form of the subjunctive is used in asking questions and making requests when we want to 
show consideration or even polite deference to the person we are talking to. The use of the past 
tense form signals the person we are talking to that that person has no obligation to agree to or 
approve our request (which is put in the form of a question). Another way to think of it is that we 
are signaling that we are not acting as a superior talking to a subordinate as might be the implica-
tion of a direct question in the present tense. For example, if we were talking to friends or social 
equals, we would probably invite them to lunch in the present tense:
Do you want to go out for lunch?
However, if we were talking to a superior or a person we did not know well, we would prob-
ably phrase the invitation in a more indirect manner using the past tense:
Did you want to go out for lunch today?
Here is another example. We would probably ask a colleague for some time by saying:
Can you give me a minute?
But we would make the same request of a superior in the past tense:
Could you give me a minute?
We would ask equals if they were ready to leave in the present tense:
Are you ready to leave?
But we would ask a superior the same thing in the past tense:
Were you ready to leave?

The future tense
In traditional grammar, the future tense consists of the helping verb will followed by a verb in its 
base form. The base form of a verb is the dictionary entry form of the verb. It is an infinitive 
without the to; for example:
I will call you as soon as I get a chance.
In this example, call is in its base form. Will plus the base-form verb call is thus the future tense 
of call.
	
The way traditional grammar defines the future tense (helping verb plus base-form verb) is 
radically different from the way that the present and past tenses are defined. The present and past 
tenses are defined by a change in the verb itself, either by adding an ending (-s in the case of the 
present; -ed in the case of the past tense) or by a change in the form of the verb, as in the case of 
irregular verbs. To understand the implications of the traditional definition of the future tense, 
we need to understand a bit about the very peculiar history of the future tense in English.
	
In the past, the ancestor language of English (called Indo-European) formed the future 
tense as all other verb tenses: by a change in the verb itself. This future tense is related to the 
future tenses that survive today in most modern-day languages of Indo-European origin, for 
example, French, Italian, Greek, Russian, and the languages of northern India.
	
Later, the common Indo-European language broke apart into separate branches. The branch 
that ultimately leads to English is Germanic (the Germanic languages besides English are Dutch, 
German, and the Scandinavian languages). One of the main characteristics of the Germanic 
branch that sets it apart from all the other branches of Indo-European is that the future tense 
verb ending totally disappeared. That is, none of the Germanic languages (including English) has 
a verb tense form that means future time.
	
The disappearance of the future tense verb form in the ancestral Germanic language was 
probably the result of another development unique to the Germanic languages: the creation of a 
remarkable set of helping verbs called modal verbs. These modal verbs provided speakers with a 
more sophisticated and flexible way of talking about the future. It is entirely likely that the future 
verb tense form was driven into extinction by the rise of these modal verbs. The modern English 
forms of the modal verbs are the following: can, may, must, shall, and will.
	
These five verbs can all be used with infinitives to talk about the future:
I can call him later.
I may call him later.
I must call him later.
I shall call him later.
I will call him later.
	
Verbs	 79
We can even use the past tense forms of these verbs (except must, which has no past tense) to talk 
about the future:
I could call him later.
I might call him later.
I should call him later.
I would call him later if I were you.
As you can see, these nine verb forms allow English speakers to talk about the future in a number 
of highly nuanced ways—much more than a single future tense verb form would ever allow.
If all of these helping verbs have evolved to become the way that English speakers talk about 
future time, then why was will singled out by traditional grammar as “the future tense” in Eng-
lish? There are two reasons: (1) will is the closest in meaning of all nine modal forms to the mean-
ing of the future tense in Latin (Latin is the basis of traditional grammars of English), and (2) the 
basic meaning of will is simple futurity; all of the other modal verbs have a variety of additional 
meanings such as necessity, possibility, and obligation. Because Latin has nothing similar to 
modal verbs, traditional Latin-based grammars of English simply ignored the remaining modal 
verbs.
In this chapter we will examine will because (1) it is the traditional marker of the future 
tense, and (2) it is by far the most common way of talking about future time. We will also exam-
ine the four nonmodal ways that English speakers commonly use to refer to future time.
Using will to talk about future time
We use will in two quite different ways: (1) prediction and (2) intention.
Will is used to make predictions about some future event, behavior, or outcome. Here are 
some examples:
The weatherman says that it will rain all day tomorrow.
You will feel better after a good night’s sleep.
The stock market will react negatively to such bad economic news.
They will never agree to such a proposal.
Who knows how soon the volcano will erupt again?
Will the store be open on Sunday?
We can also use will in a somewhat different way to talk about characteristic behaviors or 
actions (which, of course, we predict will reoccur in the future); for example:
Sally will play with that toy all day.
They will end up arguing about politics as usual.
My father will want to pick up the check.
The market will, as usual, overreact to any unexpected development.
On vacation we will get up late every morning and go for a walk before breakfast.
Will is also used to make a statement of someone’s intention to carry out some future action. 
This use of will requires an animate subject that acts volitionally to carry out a purposeful future 
act. Here are some examples:
I will give you a hand with that.
He will call you back as soon as he gets a chance.
I will stop by after work if it is not too late.
Jerry will never allow that to happen.
The company will petition the court for an injunction to stop the strike.

This meaning of will is used for requests for future actions and questions about a person’s inten-
tions or willingness to do something in the future; for example:
Will you answer the phone?
Will you set the table, please?
Will you be able to attend the meeting?
Will the union cooperate?
Will used as an expression of intention is often replaced in questions or requests by would as 
a form of respect or politeness; for example:
Will/would you help me with this?
Will/would that be OK with you?
Will/would you take care of that?
Would you like to dance?
(For a detailed discussion of polite questions and deferential requests, see Chapter 3, “The past 
tense.”)

Other ways of talking about future time
There are four nonmodal ways to talk about future time:
Present progressive tense
Present tense
	 Be going to plus base form
	 Be about to plus base form
The present progressive and present tenses are similar in meaning, but the present progres-
sive tense is much broader in its use than the present tense. We will discuss the present progres-
sive tense first, then we will turn to the more restricted present tense, and finally we will discuss 
the differences and similarities between these two ways of talking about the future.
Present progressive tense
The present progressive tense refers to future events that arise directly (and often immediately) 
from present plans, arrangements, or commitments; for example:
We are continuing the presentation after lunch.
The children are going to the park this afternoon.
They are taking a taxi to the airport.
The president is making a speech here next month.
My parents are staying in Arizona this winter.
As you can see from these examples, the present progressive tense is often used with animate 
subjects; these subjects are the ones who make the plans, the arrangements, or the commitments 
that cause the future action. The present progressive can also be used with inanimate subjects, but 
only if the action or event is arranged, scheduled, or highly predictable; for example:
The play is opening Friday night.
According to the weather channel, it’s getting warmer tomorrow.
The trains are running on a holiday schedule Monday.
The cherry trees in Washington are blooming next week.
Our team is playing at home next week.
There is one important restriction on the use of the present progressive: many stative verbs 
cannot be used in the present progressive. Here are some examples with stative verbs:
X  We are needing to change trains at the next station.
X  They are wanting to talk to us.
X  The kids are feeling bad if we don’t come.
	
82

We often use the present progressive for announcing imminent actions or events; for example:
We are ordering takeout; let me know what you want.
Your coffee is getting cold.
Kids, we’re leaving soon.
Come to the table; we’re eating in just a minute.
Hurry, the game is starting right after this commercial.
The market is opening in five minutes.
Present tense
The present tense can refer to future events, but only if those events have already been deter-
mined. It is the tense we would use for scheduled or fixed events; for example:
Jayne’s wedding is June 18.
Our plane departs at 8:15.
I see the dentist next Tuesday.
They get back next week.
The plays there start at 8:30.
We cannot use the present tense for unscheduled future actions or events; for example:
X  It rains tomorrow.
X  They are upset if we don’t get the contract.
X  I come back early unless there is a problem.
X  We go home soon.
The use of the present tense for future time is more restricted than the present progressive. 
For example, all of the following sentences in the present progressive are grammatical:
We are ordering takeout; let me know what you want.
Your coffee is getting cold.
Kids, we are leaving now.
Come to the table; we are eating in just a minute.
Hurry, the game is starting right after this commercial.
The market is opening in a few minutes.
When we use the present tense in these same examples, the results are surprisingly diverse: 
some (marked with X) are flatly ungrammatical, some (marked with ?) are probably grammatical 
but sound odd, and some are perfectly grammatical:
X  We order takeout; let me know what you want.
X  Your coffee gets cold.
?  Kids, we leave now.
?  Come to the table; we eat in just a minute.
Hurry, the game starts right after this commercial.
The market opens in a few minutes.
The degree of grammaticality in using the present tense is a function of how formally the 
future event is scheduled. In the first two examples, there is no scheduling or planning at all; they 
are extemporaneous, unplanned statements about the future, and, as such, they are clearly incom-
patible with the present tense:
X  We order takeout; let me know what you want.
X  Your coffee gets cold.
	
Verbs	 83
The last two examples refer to formally scheduled future events:
Hurry, the game starts right after this commercial.
The market opens in a few minutes.
These are completely grammatical in the present tense.
The middle two examples are in between planned and unplanned. That is, they are not for-
mally planned, but they are not really extemporaneous either. The borderline grammaticality of 
these two sentences reflects the fact that they are quasi-planned.
?  Kids, we leave now.
?  Come to the table; we eat in just a minute.
Here is another pair of sentences that illustrates the difference between the present and 
present progressive for future time:
Present	
X  I take a group picture after class.
Present progressive	
I am taking a group picture after class.
Both of these sentences are talking about carrying out a future-time activity. The problem with 
using the present tense is that the activity is not formally scheduled. Its extemporaneous nature 
makes it incompatible with the present tense. Using the present tense this way is a common mis-
take for even advanced nonnative speakers of English.
	 The much tighter restrictions on the use of the present tense mean that many verbs that can be 
used quite normally in the present progressive for future time cannot be used in the present tense.

EXERCISE
All of the following sentences contain grammatical uses of the present progressive tense. 
Change each use of the present progressive into the present tense, and then determine the 
grammatical validity of the result. If the result is fully grammatical, write “OK.” If the result is 
not grammatical or is distinctly odd, write “Not OK.” The first two sentences are done as 
examples.
She is having a baby next June.
Answer: 	
She has a baby next June. Not OK
She is going into the hospital next week.
Answer: 	
She goes into the hospital next week. OK
	 1.	 Everyone is staying with friends until the water recedes.

	 8.	 Because of global warming, some insurance companies are raising their flood insurance 
rates next year.

	 9.	 The contractor is laying the carpet as soon as he can get the pad installed.

	10.	 I am teaching that class next semester.

The difference we have seen between present progressive and present tense carries over to 
situations in which both the present progressive and present tenses are grammatical. For exam-
ple, compare the following sentences:
Present progressive	
Our flight is leaving at 8:15.
Present	
Our flight leaves at 8:15.
These two sentences mean the same thing, but there is a difference in their implications. Using 
the present progressive implies that this is new information: either it is new information to the 
person being spoken to, or the original flight departure time has been changed, and thus it is new 
information for everybody. If it is the latter, there is the additional implication that this new time 
is not firmly scheduled and is thus subject to further change.
Using the present tense implies that the flight is definitely scheduled to leave at 8:15. If this is 
a new time, it implies that this new time is a formal rescheduling of the original departure time, 
and as such we have some expectation that this departure time is reliable information.
Finally, we need to mention another, unrelated use of the present tense for future time. We 
use it in adverb clauses when the main clause uses will to indicate future time; for example:
If she pushes this button, the outdoor lights will go on.
	
adverb clause	
main clause
When he moves there next month, he will need to get new furniture.
  adverb clause	
main clause
The adverb and main clause can be used in either order:
The outdoor lights will go on if she pushes this button.
	
	
      main clause	
  adverb clause
He will need to get new furniture when he moves there next month.
main clause	
  adverb clause
See Chapter 2 for a detailed discussion of this rather specialized use of the present tense.
	
Verbs	 85
Be going to plus base form
This idiomatic construction uses some form of be in the present tense to express future action; for 
example:
I am going to take the 5:45 train.
The price of gold is going to fall dramatically.
An alternative analysis would be to describe this construction as follows:
be going plus infinitive
An infinitive consists of to plus a base-form verb. Obviously, either description will work. The rea-
son that linguists prefer be going to plus base-form verb is that is it easy to break the construction 
apart between the to and the base-form verb, suggesting that the to is more like a preposition than 
the marker of an infinitive. Here is a brief dialogue that separates the to from the base-form verb:
A: Do you think George will ever retire?
B: Yes, I think he actually is going to this summer. (Retire is understood.)
If to retire were a single grammatical unit, we would not expect to separate the to and retire so 
easily.
Here are some more examples of this construction:
Aunt Mae and Uncle Jim are going to sell the farm.
The storm is going to hit sometime tomorrow morning.
Our mayor is going to run for Congress this fall.
When the subject is an animate noun, be going to plus base-form verb signals a strong inten-
tion of the subject to carry out the future action specified, almost as a statement of commitment. 
Here are some more examples with animate subjects:
We are going to get married.
The company is going to open a new branch in Seattle.
They are going to meet us at the park.
I am going to mow the lawn now.
With inanimate subjects, the speaker is asserting confidence that the described future event 
is highly likely to actually happen; for example:
It’s going to start raining any minute.
The reception is going to be at her aunt’s house.
His speech is going to create a lot of controversy.
The train is going to be half an hour late.
We can even use this construction with non-referential, existential subjects like there and it 
as long as the speaker has confidence in the validity of what is said:
There is going to be a staff meeting Friday.
It’s going to be really hot tomorrow.
Be about to plus base form
This is another idiomatic construction that also uses some form of be in the present tense to 
express future action; for example:
Hurry, the light is about to change.
Let’s sit down. The presentation is about to begin.
	
86	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
I’m about to give up.
The boat is about to leave.
The to in this construction also acts as a preposition rather than the marker of an infinitive 
because we can so easily separate the to and the verb; for example:
A: Are you going to quit soon?
B: Yes, I am just about to. (Quit is understood.)
Be about to plus base form is used to emphasize that something is on the verge of happening. 
It is used to emphasize the immediacy of what is going to happen in the very near future. Be about 
to plus base form can be used only with verbs that convey a strong sense of immediate action. As 
we would expect, this construction is most often used with verbs that have animate subjects that 
perform the action of the verb; for example:
John is about to look for a new job.
The company is about to open a new plant in Mexico.
Can’t it wait? We’re just about to leave.
The president is about to make an important announcement.
We are about to buy our first new car.
Be about to plus base form can be used with inanimate subjects but only if there is a sense of 
immediacy in the sentence. The action does not need to be caused by the subject of the sentence. 
Here are some examples:
The house is about to go on the market.
Their job description is about to change drastically.
The field is about to be flooded for irrigation.
We can also use impersonal subjects; for example:
It’s about to start raining.
There is about to be a big fight over the proposed new law.
Summary of ways of talking about the future
In this chapter we have identified the following six ways of talking about the future: 
	 Will plus base form (prediction)
Animate	
They will call us as soon as they hear anything.
Inanimate	
It will take about 45 minutes to get to the airport.
	 Will plus base form (intention)
Animate	
I will take you to the airport.
Inanimate	
(rarely used)
Comment: will plus base form is used for normal expectations about future actions 
or events.
	 Present progressive tense
Animate	
I am taking them to the airport.
Inanimate	
The meeting is starting at 4:30.
Comment: with animate nouns, the present progressive refers to future events that 
arise directly from present plans, arrangements, or commitments. With inanimate nouns, 
the present progressive refers to events that are arranged or highly predictable. We often 
use the present progressive for announcing imminent actions or events, especially if the 
actions or events are new information.
	
Verbs	 87
	 Present tense
Animate	
Alice takes the kids to camp tomorrow.
Inanimate	
Their flight leaves at 6:30.
Comment: the present tense is used to describe an action or event that has been 
scheduled or prearranged.
	 Be going to plus base form
Animate	
I’m going to give them a call right now.
Inanimate	
Their flight is going to be a little late.
Comment: with animate nouns, be going to plus base form signals a strong intention 
or even commitment to carry out a future action. With inanimate nouns, be going to plus 
base form asserts confidence that the described future event will actually happen.
	 Be about to plus base form
Animate	
They are about to board their plane.
Inanimate	
The plane is about to take off.
Comment: with both animate and inanimate subjects, be about to plus base form 
emphasizes the immediacy of the action of the verb.
In deciding what form to use for talking about future time, here are some things to keep in 
mind:
	 Will plus base form is the default way of talking about the future. That is, we use will plus 
base form unless we have a particular reason for using one of the other forms.
	 The present progressive and be going to plus base form are used very frequently in conver-
sation because they both imply information that is new to the audience. For example, 
compare the following uses of will plus base form, present progressive, and be going to 
plus base form:
Will plus base form	
I’ll take the bus to work tomorrow.
Present progressive	
I’m taking the bus to work tomorrow.
Be going to plus base form	
I’m going to take the bus to work tomorrow.
All three sentences have the same basic meaning. However, they do not have the 
same implications. The use of will plus base form implies that taking the bus to work is 
something that the speaker does frequently so that the sentence is merely confirming a 
normal practice. Both the present progressive and the be going to plus base form, however, 
are announcing something that is new to the audience and/or is worth singling out for 
special emphasis.
Here is the opposite situation where the “new information” aspect of the present progressive 
and be going to plus base form are inappropriate. Imagine it’s the end of the workday; two col-
leagues are leaving the office at the same time, and each says “good-bye” to the other with the 
following verb forms:
Will plus base form	
I’ll see you tomorrow.
Present progressive	
I’m seeing you tomorrow.
Be going to plus base form	
I’m going to see you tomorrow.
	
88	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
The “new information” verb forms are utterly socially inappropriate because they 
(incorrectly) imply that seeing the other person at work the next day is the result of some 
special arrangement; it is not something that just normally happens.
	 The remaining two verb forms, present tense and be about to plus base form, are essen-
tially special-purpose verb forms: the present tense is used solely for future events that are 
already scheduled or fixed; be about to plus base form is used to emphasize the immedi-
acy of the future action or event.
To summarize:
	 Normal expectations about future actions or events: will plus base form
	 New information about future actions or events: present progressive or be going to plus 
base form
	 Scheduled or fixed future events: present tense
	 Immediate future actions or events: be about to plus base form

you, we, and they and with the nouns these pronouns can replace. For example, 
the students takes the same verb form as they. An ending, either -s or -es, is added 
to the verb when the subject pronoun is he, she, or it or a noun these pronouns can 
replace. The -s ending is used most frequently. The -es ending is used after certain 
letters or letter ­combinations.

Simple past 
When you refer to past or completed actions, states, or events, use simple past ­verb forms.
Completed action: We drove three hundred ­miles.
Past state: They seemed ­uneasy.
Past event: The schedule ­changed.
You can also use the simple past to refer to a hypothetical action, state, or ­event.

Hypothetical action: If you joined our team, we could win the ­championship.
Sentences such as this one will be discussed in more detail in Part IV.
The simple past for regular verbs consists of the verb and the ending -ed.
	
Singular	
Plural
First Person	
I verb + ed	
we verb + ed
Second Person	
you verb + ed	
you verb + ed
Third Person	
he, she, it verb + ed	
they verb + ed
For regular verbs, the simple past form and the perfect/participles are the ­same.
When a one-syllable word or a word with a stressed final syllable ends in a single consonant 
sound, double the last letter before adding -ed.
One-syllable word: plan → ­planned
Word ending in a stressed syllable: occur → ­occurred
BUT row → rowed [This word ends in a vowel ­sound.]
Irregular verbs have a variety of simple past forms, which can be found in the appendix.

Imperative
When you want to give instructions or directions, you can use the ­imperative:
Instruction: Mix the ingredients ­together.
Direction: Turn right at the ­corner.
Imperatives are used for other purposes as ­well:
Request: Close the window, ­please.
Warning: Watch out!
Invitation: Come over to our house ­tonight.
Wish: Have a nice ­time.
Using the verb in the imperative construction is easy because there are no endings. Just use 
the base form (the form found in the ­dictionary).
Because imperatives are directed toward another person or other persons, the subject you is 
understood; that is, it is not mentioned except for ­emphasis.

Using imperatives
Imperatives, or commands, are as important in good sentence writing as any other grammatical 
element. It is essential to differentiate among the various types of imperatives in order to use 
them appropriately and effectively.
You as the subject of an imperative
Most imperatives are made to the second-person singular or plural (you), although the pronoun 
is not stated.
imperative form of a verb + predicate → command
Certain gruff or impolite-sounding imperatives cannot be used in every situation. Some of 
these are said in a casual manner, while others are said in anger or out of belligerence. For 
example:
Shut up!		 	
Get out!
Be quiet!	 	
Don’t ever say that again!
Don’t ever do that again!	
Stop it!
Hurry up!		
Leave me alone!
Shut your mouth!	
Give me that!
Let go!	 	 	
Take your time!
The exclamation point
Most imperatives of this nature are punctuated with an exclamation point, but imperatives can 
also be punctuated with a period. An exclamation point in writing is a signal that the imperative 
is stated with great emphasis. For example:
Stand up!	 	
emphatic, perhaps angry in tone
Stand up.	 	
milder but still casual and a bit gruff in tone
Other short imperatives can be written with an exclamation point when they are pleas or 
urgent requests. For example:
Have a heart!	
Be patient!	
Stand back!	
Keep moving!
Don’t joke about that!	
Hold on tight!
Don’t excite the dog!	
Make some room for me!

Exercise
Respond to each incident described with a gruff or angry imperative.
	 1.	 Someone approaches you menacingly and says, “I’m going to get you.”
	 2.	 Someone has unlocked your diary and is reading through it.
	 3.	 Someone continues to refuse to leave your home.
	 4.	 Someone is acting foolishly and is teasing you.
	 5.	 Someone is packing a suitcase slowly although the hour of departure is near.
	 6.	 Someone is pestering you and making you annoyed.
Follow the same directions, but respond with a plea or an urgent request.
	 7.	 A child is leaning down to pet a vicious dog.
	 8.	 You’re riding fast on a motorcycle and you tell your passenger to be careful.
	 9.	 You are thirsty and would like a soft drink.
	10.	 You feel that someone should be kinder.
Please
Most imperatives are usually said with a certain amount of courtesy. The inclusion of please soft-
ens the tone of the command. Certainly, please wait here sounds nicer than wait here. Therefore, 
it is wise to include the word please in most commands. However, its position in a sentence and 
the addition or lack of a comma can change the general meaning of the sentence significantly.
If an imperative begins with please, it has the same meaning as when it ends with please.
please + imperative verb + predicate
Please + lend + me a dollar.
imperative verb + predicate + please
Lend + me a dollar +, please.
	
More about Verbs	 103
If please is written at the end of an imperative, as in the example just shown, it is preceded 
by a comma. Here are more examples:
Please sign here.	
Sign here, please.
Please fill out this form.	
Fill out this form, please.
Please fasten your seat belts.	
Fasten your seat belts, please.
A comma placed after an initial please changes the courteous meaning to one that suggests 
impatience or exasperation. In speech, the word please would be followed by a pause before the 
imperative is given. In writing, the pause is indicated by a comma.
Courteous	
Impatient
Please keep back from the fire.	
Please, keep back from the fire.
Please don’t feed the animals.	
Please, don’t feed the animals.
Please move along quickly.	
Please, move along quickly.
If the imperative is meant to show impatience or exasperation, it can be punctuated with an 
exclamation point:
Please, control your temper!

Let’s and let
While most imperatives are said to the second-person-singular or second-person-plural pronoun 
you, some can include the person giving the command. Imperatives of this type begin with the 
contraction let’s (let us) and are followed by an infinitive phrase. Infinitive phrases that follow 
let’s omit the particle word to. Let’s conveys that the person giving the command will participate 
in the action of the command; for example, Let’s listen to some music. In this sentence, the 
speaker suggests that you listen to some music, and the speaker will join you in that activity. Let’s 
is the contraction of let us, but the uncontracted form is used less often.
let’s + infinitive phrase
Let’s + go home.
Here are a few more examples:
Let’s take a look at that scratch on your arm.
Let’s work on a new way of blocking unwanted e-mails.
Let’s see what’s on today’s agenda.
If the verb let is used without the contraction of us (let’s), it still is an imperative, but it has 
a different meaning. In this case, the person giving the command is suggesting that “you” allow 
someone or something to perform an action. The structure consists of let followed by a direct 
object and an infinitive phrase with the particle word to omitted.
let + direct object + infinitive phrase
Let + them + sleep until ten.

How about
Another version of an imperative appears in the form of a question. It begins with the phrase how 
about and is followed by a gerund and its complement. This kind of imperative sounds more like 
a suggestion than a command, and since it is in the form of a question, it gives the impression that 
it is no command at all. Also, it includes the command giver in the action. Let’s peruse some 
examples:
How about going to the movies tonight?
How about having dinner at the Bella Luna Café?
How about giving me a hand with this heavy chest?
Why don’t you
Yet another version of an imperative also appears in the form of a question. It begins with why 
don’t you and is followed by an infinitive phrase. Unlike imperatives with how about, this imper-
ative does not include the command giver in the action of the verb.
Why don’t you go out and play for a while?
Why don’t you get dressed and come down for breakfast?
Why don’t you think about what you just said?
If you change the pronoun you to we in this imperative, the command giver is now included 
in the action of the verb. For example:
Why don’t we try to get along a little better?
Why don’t we set a trap for that pesky raccoon?
Why don’t we take a little trip downtown and do some shopping?
6·16
Exercise
Using each infinitive phrase provided, form three imperative sentences: one with how about, one 
with why don’t you, and one with why don’t we.

Why don’t you speak to him about it?
	
	
Why don’t we speak to him about it?

Modal auxiliary verbs
Modal auxiliary verbs appear before main verbs. They are used for a number of purposes. Here 
are some of the most ­common:
Indicate ability: She can speak ­English.
Give advice: You should see a ­doctor.
Express certainty: We will finish by ­8:00.
Indicate possibility: It may rain ­tonight.
Indicate obligation: You must attend the last ­class.
Give permission: You may use your dictionaries during the ­exam.
Indicate past habit: When I was little, we would go swimming every day.
Unlike other verbs, modal verbs have only one form. In other words, no -s is added to modal 
verbs to indicate third-person ­singular.

Semi-modal auxiliary ­verbs
English also has semi-modal auxiliary verbs. They are used for many of the same purposes as 
modal auxiliary ­verbs.
Indicate ability: He is able to speak three different ­languages.
Give advice: You ought to finish the ­report.
Express certainty: We are going to complete the project ­tonight.
Indicate obligation: You have to attend the ­meeting.
Indicate past habit: We used to play basketball ­together.
Unlike one-word modal verbs, most semi-modals are marked for number and ­tense.
I am able to go.	
I was able to go.
You have to give a speech.	
You had to give a ­speech.
We are going to leave.

Used to is an exception. It has only one form and always refers to the past. Ought to is 
another exception. It does not change form; however, the main verb that follows it can.

What is so “perfect” about the perfect tenses? Nothing. The use of perfect as a 
grammatical term comes from the Latin verb perficere, “to do something com-
pletely or to bring something to a successful completion.” The modern English 
word perfect is normally used as an adjective, but we still keep one of the original 
Latin verb meanings of perficere, “to bring to a successful completion.” For exam-
ple, a tennis player might say, “I am trying to perfect my backhand.” (Note: The 
verb perfect is even pronounced differently from the adjective perfect. The verb is 
stressed on the second syllable, “perFECT,” while the adjective is stressed on the 
first syllable, “PERfect.”) Over time the English verb perfect developed a second-
ary meaning of “to finish or complete.” It is this meaning that the grammatical 
term perfect draws on: the perfect tenses have a stated or implied finishing point.
There are three perfect tenses: the present perfect, the past perfect, and the 
future perfect. All three are formed in exactly parallel manner: the appropriate 
present, past, or future tense form of the helping verb have followed by a verb in 
the past participle form; for example:
Present perfect	
Joan has lived in Denver for five years.
Past perfect	
Joan had lived in Denver for five years  
	
  before she moved last May.
Future perfect	
Joan will have lived in Denver for five  
	
  years this May.
The most common use of the present perfect is for past-time actions or 
events whose actions or consequences continue until they are terminated, for 
example, “perfected,” at the present moment of time.
Joan has lived in Denver for five years.
In our example sentence, the use of the present perfect has lived means that Joan 
moved to Denver five year ago and has continued to live in Denver right up to the 
present moment of time.
The past perfect is used for some more distant past time, or past actions or 
events that were terminated, “perfected,” at some more recent moment of past 
time, or by some more recent past-time event.
Joan had lived in Denver for five years before she moved last May.
In our example sentence, the use of the past perfect had lived means that Joan lived 
in Denver for five years until she moved in May. Joan’s moving in May is the more 
recent past-time event that terminated the action of the past perfect verb had lived.

The future perfect is used for future-time actions or events that will be terminated, 
­“perfected,” by an even more distant moment of time or defining event.
Joan will have lived in Denver for five years this May.
In our example sentence, the use of the present perfect will have lived means that as of this ­coming 
May, Joan has lived in Denver for five years. This May is the more distant future-time expression 
that terminates the action of the future perfect verb will have lived.

One of the mildly unusual features of the perfect tenses is that they can be used with both 
stative and dynamic verbs. The basic meaning of stative verbs, states that continue over time, is a 
perfect match for the ongoing nature of the perfect tenses. Here are the three perfect tenses with 
examples of both stative and dynamic verbs:
Present perfect
Stative	
John has been a good friend.
Dynamic	
John has signed the agreement.
Past perfect
Stative	
John had been in graduate school at the time.
Dynamic	
John had majored in accounting before he  
	
	
  switched to music.

The present perfect tense
The present perfect tense consists of a present tense form of the helping verb have followed by a 
verb in the past participle form; for example:
He has been out sick all week.
The business has expanded steadily for the past several years.
I think that I have guessed the answer.
Have you seen Harry recently?
We have had a busy day.
I’ve just heard the news.
The present perfect tense is used to talk about past-time events that directly affect the pres-
ent. Notice that none of the previous examples actually mentions the present moment of time; 
they do not need to because the linkage to the present moment of time is inherent in the meaning 
of the present perfect. To confirm that this is the case, note what happens when we use past-time 
adverbs in the examples; they all become ungrammatical:
X  He has been out sick all last week.
X  The business has expanded steadily several years ago.
X  I think that I have guessed the answer last week.
X  Have you seen Harry yesterday?
X  We have had a busy day last Monday.
X  I’ve heard the news last week.
We use the present perfect tense in two different ways: the main use of the present perfect 
is for past-time events that have continued over past time up to the present moment of time. We 
will call this the continuous use of the present perfect.
We also use the present perfect for very recent single past-time events that directly impact the 
present. We will call this the noncontinuous use of the present perfect. We will discuss the noncon-
tinuous use of the present perfect after we have discussed the more frequent continuous use.
The continuous use of the present perfect
Here are some examples of the continuous present perfect:
My parents have lived in their house for 30 years.
I have worked there for two years.
She has delivered papers at many major conferences.
Their company has been in business for more than 100 years.
He has owned that truck for as long as I have known him.
I haven’t seen my cousin in years.
As was mentioned in Chapter 5, one of the characteristics of all the perfect tenses is that 
both stative and dynamic verbs can be used freely in all of them. However, there is a difference in 
the way that the two types of verbs are used. In the present perfect, stative verbs, because of their 
inherent meaning of an ongoing state or condition, always are normally used with the meaning 
of an unbroken span of time up to the present moment. Here are some examples of stative verbs:
I have always disliked broccoli.
Our family has always had dogs.
Americans have always loved happy endings in their movies.
	
116

John has been a close friend ever since college.
This project has cost us a small fortune.
We have always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Dynamic verbs, on the other hand, typically describe actions that are necessarily intermit-
tent because they start and stop over a period of time. For example, we can legitimately describe 
the following sentence as continuous in the very real sense that Sam’s voting is an activity that is 
repeated regularly over time, even though he can vote only when elections are held—every two 
years.
Sam has voted in every election since he was 18.
In the following sentence, Barbara’s actions are continuous in the sense that we can imagine 
Barbara systematically climbing one peak after another until she has climbed them all.
Barbara has climbed every major peak in the Rockies.
In the next sentence, the speaker’s infrequent use of his tuxedo still constitutes an activity 
that has been performed multiple times up to the present moment.
I have worn my tuxedo only three times in the past 20 years.
Here are some more examples of dynamic verbs used in the continuous present perfect:
The kids have gone to the same camp for the past four years.
Our basement has flooded every spring.
I have always parked on the street when I visit them.
Over the years, hail storms have damaged a lot of crops in the area.
She has directed more than 20 plays in her long career.
Our baseball team has won about half of its games.


	 9.	 We have lost too many games this season because of poor preparation.

10.	 We have always eaten there when we are in town.

The noncontinuous use of the present perfect
The present perfect also allows for a noncontinuous or single-event use of the perfect tense. Here 
are some examples of noncontinuous uses:
The printer has just run out of ink.
The meeting has been canceled.
The committee has demanded a second vote.
The team has picked a new captain.
We have found the problem, and we can fix it in a few hours.
As you can see, all of these examples describe a one-time only action or event. There is no con-
tinuous state or repeated action across a span of time.
In the noncontinuous use of the present perfect, this single, recently completed, past-
time event or action directly and immediately affects the present moment of time. This is in 
contrast to the normal continuous use of the present perfect, which describes a series of 
events or actions that span a period of past time up to the present moment. For example, 
compare the following:
Continuous	
There have been a lot of bad accidents   
	
  on the freeway lately.
Noncontinuous	
There has been a bad accident on the  
	
  freeway.
The first sentence with the continuous use of the present perfect describes a situation in which 
a number of accidents have occurred on the freeway over a span of time. The second sentence 
with the noncontinuous use of the present perfect describes a single recent accident on the 
freeway. Using the noncontinuous present perfect emphasizes that (1) the information about 
the accident is new (and quite possibly not previously known to the audience) and (2) this 
information impacts the present situation in some way; in our example, the freeway might be 
closed for hours.

As we would expect, the noncontinuous present perfect is closely tied to the present moment 
of time. If we shift the time frame of a noncontinuous present perfect sentence to a more distant 
point in past time, the sentence becomes ungrammatical. For example, compare the following 
pairs of sentences:
Present time	
Their daughter has just graduated from NYU.
Past time	
X  Their daughter has just graduated from  
	
  NYU last week.
Present time	
I’ve just read your letter.
Past time	
X  I’ve just read your letter last night.
Present time	
We have enjoyed meeting your family.
Past time	
X  We have enjoyed meeting your family yesterday.
In all these examples, the use of the noncontinuous present perfect is totally incompatible with a 
past-time adverb.

	 4.	 The conference has arranged transportation for you.

	 5.	 I’ve found the reference I had been looking for.

	 6.	 I see that they have built an outdoor pool.

	 7.	 We have paid by credit card before whenever we have stayed here.


	 8.	 Wages have increased about 3 percent a year for the past 20 years.

	 9.	 They have finally made up their minds.

10.	 We have always used premium gas in that car.

To understand the meaning and function of the noncontinuous use of the present perfect, 
we need to contrast it with its alternative: the past tense. In many cases the noncontinuous present 
perfect and the past tense are interchangeable from a strictly grammatical point of view. For 
example, we can use the noncontinuous present perfect or the past tense equally well in the 
­following sentences:
Present perfect	
There has been a mistake on my income tax.
Past tense	
There was a mistake on my income tax.
Present perfect	
I’ve seen the final report.
Past tense	
I saw the final report.
Present perfect	
Elvis has left the building.
Past tense	
Elvis left the building.
However, the implications of the noncontinuous and the past tenses can be quite different.
As we saw in Chapter 3, the past tense is used for events, conditions, or states that are now 
over and done with. To illustrate this point, we used this example:
Samantha went to school at Berkeley.
The sentence not only tells us where Samantha went to school, but the use of the past tense also 
tells us that Samantha is no longer going to school there. The key point in understanding the 
­difference between the noncontinuous present perfect tense and the past tense is that the past 
tense erects a wall between past-time events (even ones that occurred in the immediate past) and 
the present moment of time.
The noncontinuous present perfect, on the other hand, highlights the connection between 
an event in the immediate and the present moment of time. Often we use the noncontinuous 
present perfect to emphasize that the past-time information is new to the audience and that the 
information is of immediate relevance to the present moment. The following pair of sentences is 
a good illustration of the differences between the noncontinuous present perfect and the past 
tense:
Present perfect	
I’ve lost my car keys.
Past tense	
I lost my car keys.
Both sentences mean the same thing. However, the present perfect sentence implies (1) that the 
fact that the speaker lost the keys is new information to the audience and (2) that it is important 
to the present moment of time. In other words, we all need to help the speaker look for the miss-
ing car keys. The past tense is simply a neutral statement of fact about something that happened 
in the past. There is no necessary implication that this is new information or that the listeners 
should do anything about it.
	
120

Using the noncontinuous present perfect rather than the past tense is a way of telling the 
audience that what we are saying is new and worth paying attention to. In this sense, it is a kind 
of emphatic form we might choose over the more standard and expected past tense. For this 
­reason we are more likely to use the noncontinuous present perfect in casual conversation than in 
writing.

The same distinction between the noncontinuous present perfect and past tenses carries 
over into questions. However, in questions the difference in implications between the noncon-
tinuous present perfect and past tenses can be more significant, sometimes even amounting to 
a shift in meaning. For example, compare the noncontinuous present perfect and past tense 
versions of the same question:
Present perfect tense	
Have you seen the play at the Civic Theater?
Past tense	
Did you see the play at the Civic Theater?
The noncontinuous present perfect with its present-time relevancy implies (among other things) 
that the play is still running at the Civic Theater and the person being addressed still has a chance 
to see it if he or she hasn’t done so already. The past tense in the second sentence definitely implies 
that the play’s run is over and that the person being addressed has no further opportunity to see 
the play even if he or she wanted to.
The previous pair of sentences is a dramatic example of how distinct the implications of 
questions in the noncontinuous present perfect and past tenses can be. The difference between 
them is usually more modest. Here is a typical example:
Present perfect tense	
Have you reported the accident to the police?
Past tense	
Did you report the accident to the police?
The first question with the noncontinuous present perfect tense reflects a built-in expecta-
tion that reporting an accident to the police is something that people would normally do. 
Thus, asking the question in the present perfect conveys a tacit expectation that the answer 
would be “yes.” The past tense question, on the other hand, is much more neutral. The past 
tense question does not voice the same expectation about reporting the accident to the police. 
It is a simple, factual question without the built-in positive implications of the noncontinu-
ous present perfect question.
Here is a second example:
Present perfect tense	
Have you ordered the pizza?
Past tense	
Did you order the pizza?
The two questions have the same basic meaning. The differences in implication, however, are 
substantial. The first question with the noncontinuous present perfect tense implies that there 
was a definite plan to order pizza. The question functions as a confirmation of the fact that the 
pizza has already been ordered as expected: the person asking this question anticipates either of 
two possible answers: “yes” or “not yet.”
The past tense question is much more neutral. Maybe the person ordered the pizza or maybe 
not—either answer is equally plausible. The use of the past tense is more like a genuine open-
ended question than the present perfect version.

The past perfect tense
The past perfect tense consists of the helping verb had (the past tense of have) followed by a verb 
in the past participle form. Here are some examples:
I called her, but she had already left for the day.
The passes were all closed because we had had so much snow.
The caller had already hung up by the time I answered the phone.
I told him that I had already made up my mind.
They bought an old house that had been built in the 1920s.
Time, the old joke goes, was invented to keep everything from happening all at once. Like-
wise, the past perfect tense was invented to keep two different past-time events from happening 
all at once. For this reason, the past perfect tense is sometimes called “the past in the past.”
The two past-time events are almost always clauses—usually an independent clause and a 
subordinate clause but sometimes two independent clauses. The clause in the past perfect tense 
describes an action or event that has been completed before the action or event in the clause in 
the past tense takes place. Here are some examples of both types of clauses:
Independent clause and subordinate clause
(Note that some types of independent and subordinate clauses can be in either order. That is, the 
clause with the past perfect tense can either precede or follow the past tense clause.)
They sold the house after they had remodeled it extensively.
	
more recent past-time event

I had just stepped into the shower when the phone rang.

The meaning and use of the past perfect tense is quite straightforward. The main difficulty 
using the past perfect tense is with sentences that contain an independent clause and an adverb 
clause because adverb clauses, unlike other types of clauses, can be moved around, making it 
more difficult to determine which clause should be in the past perfect tense and which should be 
in the past tense. Accordingly, we will focus the remaining discussion of the past perfect tense on 
sentences containing an independent clause and an adverb subordinate clause.
Let us begin by looking closely at an example of a sentence with an adverb clause:
I had been an intern for two years before they made me a job offer.
	
main clause	
adverb clause
The past perfect portion of the sentence in the main clause expresses the older time—the two-
year period that the speaker was an intern. The past tense portion of the sentence in the adverb 
clause expresses a second, more recent event—the speaker’s being offered a job. The whole point 
of using the past perfect tense is to separate this sentence, all of which takes place in the past, into 
two distinct past-time frames—the older time period of the internship and the more recent event 
of the job offer. The use of the two different tenses enables us to place the two past-time events 
into a clear and unequivocal chronological sequence.
	
Sometimes the time sequencing imposed by the two different tenses can even imply a cause-
and-effect relationship between the two clauses. For example:
They had had a big fight just before they broke up.
	
  main clause        adverb clause
This sequencing leads us to think that their fight may have caused their subsequent breakup.
	
Auxiliary Verbs	 127
	
Adverb clauses are dependent clauses that play the role of adverbs. As with single-word 
adverbs, adverb clauses modify verbs by giving more information about the time, place, manner, 
or cause of the action of the verb. Here we are concerned only with adverb clauses that give infor-
mation about time or (occasionally) cause.
	
In our first set of examples of past perfect tenses in adverb clauses, all of the past perfect 
tenses will be in the main clause:
The driver had suffered a heart attack before the car ran off the road.
	
main clause	
adverb clause
The plane had been airborne for about two hours when the left engine quit.

He had committed himself to the plan before he knew all the facts.
	
main clause	
adverb clause
We had repainted the house before we put it on the market.
	
main clause	
adverb clause
One of the characteristics of adverb clauses is that they can be moved from their normal position 
following the main clause to a position in front of the main clause. (When we move the adverb clause 
in front of the main clause, the adverb clause is said to be inverted.) We must separate the inverted 
introductory adverb clause from the main clause by a comma. (We do not use a comma to separate 
the main clause from the adverb clause when the adverb clause is in a position following the main 
clause.) Here are the previous example sentences now with the adverb clauses in inverted positions:
Before the car ran off the road, the driver had suffered a heart attack.

Inverting adverb clauses has no effect on the grammatical meaning of the sentence. The only 
difference is in emphasis: putting the adverb clause first gives it greater relative emphasis, following the 
general rhetorical principle that any grammatical structure moved out of its normal ­position (espe-
cially when it is moved to the first position in the sentence) automatically becomes more prominent.

Summary of sentences with adverb clauses
Using the past perfect tenses with sentences that contain adverb clauses is confusing for two rea-
sons: (1) adverb clauses can be either in their normal positions after main clauses or they can be 
inverted, and (2) it is quite common for the past perfect tense to be used in the main clause rather 
than the adverb clause. Thus, there are no fewer than four possibilities for where the past perfect 
tense can occur:
	 The past perfect tense is in a main clause in its normal initial position.
Example: We had packed a picnic lunch before we left.
	
main clause	
 adverb clause
	 The past perfect tense is in a main clause, but the main clause is in the second position 
following an inverted adverb clause.
Example: Before we left, we had packed a picnic lunch.
	 The past perfect tense is in the adverb clause in its normal position following the main 
clause.
Example: It took a while to clean the pot because the rice had boiled over.
	 The past perfect tense is in an adverb clause inverted to a position in front of the main 
clause.
Example: Because the rice had boiled over, it took a while to clean the pot.
	
Auxiliary Verbs	 133
The future perfect tense
The future perfect tense verb form consists of will have (the future tense form of have) followed 
by a verb in the past perfect form. Here are some examples:
By then, everyone will have finished eating.
The office will have closed before we can get there.
They will have lived in Japan for six years this coming January.
The future perfect tense, as all of the perfect tenses, must be terminated or “perfected” by an 
even more distant moment of time or defining event. In the case of the future perfect tense, this 
more distant moment is defined by an adverb prepositional phrase (usually beginning with the 
preposition by) or by an adverb clause of time. Here are some examples:
Terminating adverb prepositional phrase
The moon will have set by midnight.
The team will have come out onto the field by now.
Amazon will have shipped our order by the end of next week.
Terminating adverb clause of time
They will have rented a place to stay before school starts in the fall.
He will have figured out the answer as soon as he gets all the clues.
The chairman will have replaced Harry before the board meets on Monday.
The future perfect tense is used to talk about future-time events or conditions that will be 
completed or concluded no later than some specified future time or future event; for example:
Specified future time
I will have entered all the data before the end of the day.
The kitchen will have stopped serving by 10:00.
I will have earned $5,000 by the end of the summer.
The storm will have blocked all the roads by nightfall.
Specified future event
The painters will have finished the interior before the carpets are laid.
We will have paid the developers a fortune by the time we are finished.
They will have gotten the tents up before it starts raining.
I will have graded the papers before class begins.
When we talk about future conditions, we often use stative verbs with an adverb of duration; 
for example:
They will have been married for 10 years this June.
	
adverb of duration
I will have owned my truck for two years this coming Labor Day.
	
adverb of duration
I will have had a cold for two weeks now.
	
adverb of duration
The difference between the future tense and the future perfect tense is that the future perfect 
tense is used to emphasize the completion of the future event. For example, compare the follow-
ing sentences:
Future tense	
We will have dinner by 7:00.
Future perfect tense	
We will have had dinner by 7:00.
The future tense sentence implies that dinner will start by 7:00. The future perfect tense implies 
that dinner will be over by 7:00.
	
134	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
Here is another example:
Future tense	
The clouds will break up by noon.
Future perfect tense	
The clouds will have broken up by noon.
The future tense sentence implies that we will have at least partial sun by noon. The future perfect 
sentence implies that the clouds will be completely gone by noon.
Here is an example where the difference is more subtle:
Future tense	
Larry will get to the office around 9:00.
Future perfect tense	
Larry will have gotten to the office around 9:00.
The sentence with the future tense envisions Larry arriving at the office at or before 9:00. The 
sentence with the future perfect tense envisions that at or before 9:00, Larry will already have 
been settled in his office for some time.
In general, we can say that the future tense envisions a future event happening. The future 
perfect tense envisions that future event as already being completed.

Present ­perfect
Use the present perfect when you want to refer to a situation that originated in the past but con-
tinues into the present or to refer to a past experience that has current ­relevance.
Past situation continuing into the present: I have lived in Dallas for six ­years.
Past experience with current relevance: We have traveled to Alaska three ­times.
For an experience to be relevant, it is usually related to a possible future experience. In the exam-
ple “We have traveled to Alaska three times,” the speaker may be considering another trip. The 
present perfect is often used in job interviews when an employer asks a prospective employee 
about his or her experience: “Have you ever driven a large vehicle?” “Have you ever used a cash 
­register?”
The present perfect consists of the auxiliary verb have and the perfect/passive form of the 
main verb. The auxiliary verb is marked for tense. The perfect/passive verb form is used to indi-
cate either the perfect aspect or the passive voice. (The passive voice will be discussed in Part IV.) 
The perfect/passive form for regular verbs consists of the base form of the verb and the ending -ed.
	
Singular	
Plural
First Person	
I have verb + ed	
we have verb + ed
Second Person	
you have verb + ed	
you have verb + ed
Third Person	
he, she, it has verb + ed	
they have verb + ed
When a one-syllable word or a word with a stressed final syllable ends in a single consonant 
sound, double the last letter before adding -ed.
One-syllable word: pet ➞ ­petted
Word ending in a stressed syllable: admit ➞ ­admitted
BUT sew ➞ sewed [This word ends in a vowel ­sound.]
The perfect/passive forms of irregular verbs can be found in the appendix.
The following are common irregular verb ­patterns:

Past perfect
Use the past perfect when you want to refer to a past action, state, or event that occurred prior to 
another time in the past. The more recent past time may be expressed as a prepositional phrase 
or as a clause in which another action, state, or event is ­mentioned.
Past action before past time: They had finished the project by ­Friday.
Past state before past action: He had been depressed before he went on ­vacation.
	
Auxiliary Verbs	 137
You can also use the past perfect to refer to a hypothetical action, state, or ­event.
Hypothetical action: If they had come earlier, they would have received free ­tickets.
Sentences such as this one will be discussed in more detail in Part IV.
The past perfect consists of the auxiliary verb have and the perfect/passive form of the main 
verb. The auxiliary verb is marked for past tense. The perfect/passive verb form is used to indicate 
either the perfect aspect or the passive voice. (The passive voice will be discussed in Part IV.) The 
perfect/passive form for regular verbs consists of the base form of the verb and the ending -ed.

Introduction to the progressive tenses
There are three progressive tenses: the present progressive, the past progressive, and the future 
progressive. The three progressive tenses are all formed in exactly parallel manner: the appropri-
ate present, past, or future tense form of the helping verb be followed by a verb in the present 
participle form; for example:
Present progressive	
They are working in the garden now.
Past progressive	
They were working in the garden earlier.
Future progressive	
They will be working in the garden this  
	
  afternoon.
The basic meaning of the progressive tense is an action in progress (thus the name progres-
sive tense) at a particular moment in time. The present progressive is an action in progress at the 
present moment or period of time. The past progressive is an action in progress at some moment 
or period in the past. The future progressive is an action in progress at some moment or period in 
the future.

The present progressive tense
The present progressive tense consists of the helping verb be in a present tense form followed by a 
verb in the present participle –ing form. Here are some examples:
Our builder is leasing some heavy equipment to clear the site.
The heavy rain is washing ruts into our front yard.
I am telephoning all of the committee members.
We are going to my parents’ home for Christmas.
It seems that traffic is getting worse every month.
I’m hoping that I could see you for a few minutes this afternoon.
He is always coming in late to meetings.
The present progressive tense has two main meanings: (1) action in progress and (2) future. 
In addition, there are two idiomatic uses of the present progressive that we will discuss at the end 
of the chapter.
Using the present progressive for action  
in progress
“Action in progress” accounts for around 80 percent of the occurrences of the present progressive. 
The term action in progress refers to the fact that we use the present progressive tense to narrate or 
depict an action or event that takes place or “progresses” (hence the name of the tense “progressive”) 
over some span of current time. What constitutes “some span of current time” is very broad.
The action can take place during the actual time of speaking; for example:
I’m just calling to say hello.
The children are opening their presents even as we speak.
Or, the action can take place over great periods of time; for example:
The Pacific plate is slowly diving under the North American plate.
The two galaxies are passing through each other over a period of millennia.
	
Auxiliary Verbs	 141
On the face of it, the present progressive tense in the sense of “action in progress” seems 
perfectly straightforward. In many ways it is, but it is surprisingly difficult for nonnative speak-
ers to use correctly. In fact, advanced nonnative speakers of English probably make more errors 
with this meaning of the present progressive tense than with any other single verb form in 
English.
The problem is not in forming the present progressive correctly or in using it in appropriate 
situations. The main problem is that there are some aspects of the progressive tenses (the present 
progressive in particular) that lead nonnative speakers to use the present progressive tense with 
stative verbs, verbs that are incompatible with the progressive tenses.
There are two important areas of differences between dynamic verbs and stative verbs that 
are especially relevant to the progressive tenses: the nature of subject-verb relationships and how 
the two types of verbs treat time.
Subject-verb relationships
Dynamic and stative verbs enter into very different relationships with their subjects. Dynamic 
verbs require the subject to be the performer or “doer” of the action of the verb. For example:
Frank answered the phone.
Janet taught English in China for a few years.
Farmer Brown planted potatoes this year.
In these dynamic verb sentences, the subjects are the performers of the action of the verbs: Frank 
performed the action of answering the phone; Janet performed the action of teaching English; 
Farmer Brown performed the action of planting potatoes.
Stative verbs enter into a different kind of relationship with their subjects, describing the 
ongoing condition or state of their subjects; for example:
Frank has a cell phone but no landline.
Janet knows a lot about teaching English in China.
Farmer Brown owns 500 acres of land in Idaho.
None of the subjects in these examples are doing anything. Instead, the verbs are describing 
something about the nature or situation of the subjects: Frank’s ownership of telephones is 
described; Janet is described as knowing a lot about teaching English in China; and Farmer 
Brown is described as owning land in Idaho (where he can grow his potatoes).
Sometimes, especially with mental or cognitive verbs, the subject-verb difference between 
stative and dynamic verbs is not obvious at first glance. Compare the following two sentences:
Betty figured out the answer to the question.
Betty knew the answer to the question.
Often with mental or cognitive verbs the difference between stative and dynamic comes down to 
this question: Is the subject intentionally performing the action of the verb? In the first example, 
Betty has actively engaged in the process of coming up with the answer to the question. The 
­solution came about only because Betty intentionally made it happen. The second example is 
­different. We don’t necessarily choose to know things. For example, all of us have the lyrics to 
hundreds of idiotic pop songs from our teenage years cluttering up our brains. We would all be 
happy to get rid of these lyrics to free up more mental storage space if only we could.
Figure (out) is thus a dynamic verb, and know is thus a stative verb. When we use the two 
verbs in the present progressive, we see the difference in grammaticality:
Betty is figuring out the answer to the question.
X  Betty is knowing the answer to the question.
	
142

Another challenge is that many verbs can be either stative or dynamic verbs depending on 
the way they are used. For example, the verb appear can be used as either a dynamic verb or a 
stative verb (note that both are grammatical in the past tense):
Dynamic verb	
Jerome appeared in a Hollywood film.
Stative verb	
Jerome appeared to be a little distracted.
In the dynamic verb sentence, appear means “play a role.” In the stative verb sentence, appear 
means “seem to other people.” As we would expect, the dynamic verb use is grammatical in the 
present progressive tense, while the stative verb use is not:
Dynamic verb	
Jerome is appearing in a Hollywood film.
Stative verb	
X  Jerome is appearing to be a little distracted.
In the dynamic verb sentence, the subject Jerome is an agent performing the action of the verb 
appear. In the stative verb sentence, the same subject is not doing anything. Instead, the sentence 
comments on how the subject Jerome seems to other people.

Time
The second major difference between dynamic and stative verbs is how they relate to time. 
Dynamic verbs are time bound; that is, the action of the verb always takes place in real 
time. Accordingly, the time of a dynamic verb’s action can always be expressed by an adverb of 
time (either an adverb prepositional phrase or an adverb clause). For example:
Jennifer bought a leather jacket.
	
144	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
This is a grammatically complete sentence without any overt expression of time. However, because 
the action of buying a jacket must take place in time, we always have the option of adding an 
adverb of time (either an adverb prepositional phrase or an adverb clause) to specify the time of 
the action; for example:
Jennifer bought a leather jacket last week. (adverb prepositional phrase)
Jennifer bought a leather jacket when she was in Denver. (adverb clause)
Stative verbs, on the other hand, are not time bound—just the opposite. Stative verbs are not 
limited at all by time.
Jennifer owns a leather jacket.
In this stative sentence, the stative verb owns describes something about the nature or character 
of the subject (Jennifer). In this case the verb tells us that she has a leather jacket. When somebody 
owns something, that state of ownership is not time bound. Ownership is an ongoing state with 
no built-in time limitation. When we own something, we own it indefinitely; we own it until we 
decide to get rid of it or otherwise lose possession of it.
If we try to modify a stative verb with an adverb of time, we are essentially mixing two 
incompatible systems: the inherently unlimited time of the stative verb with the limitation of the 
adverb of time. The result is necessarily both ungrammatical and nonsensical:
X  Jennifer owns a leather jacket at five this afternoon. (adverb prepositional phrase)
X  Jennifer owns a leather jacket when she goes to dinner. (adverb clause)

Different verb tenses interact with dynamic and stative verbs in different ways. The past 
tense is unusual in that it is equally accepting of both dynamic and stative verbs; for example:
Dynamic verb	
Jennifer bought a leather jacket last week.
Stative verb	
Jennifer owned a leather jacket when she  
	
	   lived in Denver.
The fact that the past tense can be freely used with both kinds of verbs is undoubtedly why most 
novels and other works of fiction are written in the past tense: writers can mix dynamic and 
stative verbs without problems of grammatical or semantic incompatibility.
The present tense will readily permit stative verbs but not dynamic verbs unless they are 
used in special ways; for example:
Stative verb	
Jennifer owns a leather jacket.
Dynamic verb	
X  Jennifer buys a leather jacket.
We can use dynamic verbs in the present tense, but only if we use adverbs of frequency to make 
the action of the verb habitual or customary (and thus not time bound as dynamic verbs normally 
are):
Dynamic verb	
Jennifer buys a leather jacket every time  
	
  she goes to Italy.
We now return to the question of why it is so difficult for nonnative speakers to correct 
errors with stative verbs in the present progressive tense.
The answer probably lies in the unique way that the present progressive tense treats time. 
The very meaning of the tense name “progressive” emphasizes that the whole purpose of the 
tense is to describe things that span (progress) across time. It would then seem that the span of 
time that is always implicit in the actions described in the present progressive tense would be 
perfectly compatible with the continuous nature of stative verbs. The fact that nonnative speak-
ers so persistently use stative verbs in the present perfect tense shows that this idea makes sense 
to them.
However, this is not the case at all. The present progressive is always time limited and 
therefore totally incompatible with the timeless nature of stative verbs. To see why this is the 
case, let us look at some typical present progressive sentences (with dynamic verbs, 
naturally):
Our team is really getting beat!
We are completely revising our landscape plan.
Did you hear that Janet Jones is running for mayor?
Note that none of these examples has any overt mention of an ending point or even of any 
expression of time. Instead, there is something much more subtle going on in these sentences. 
Whenever we use the present progressive tense, the action of the sentence exists in its own implied 
self-defined, self-limiting time frame. For example:
Our team is really getting beat!
In this sentence, the action exists only as long as the game lasts.
We are completely revising our landscape plan.
In this example, the action lasts however long it takes the speakers to revise their landscaping plan.
Did you hear that Janet Jones is running for mayor?
In this third example, the action lasts however long Janet Jones’s mayoral campaign lasts.
	
Auxiliary Verbs	 147
The most striking demonstration of the self-defined, self-limiting time frame of verbs in the 
present progressive is with verbs whose meaning would seem to make them inherently unlimited 
in terms of time. One such verb is live. Compare the meaning of the verb live in the present tense 
with the meaning of the same verb in the present progressive tense:
Present tense	
The Johnstons live in San Diego. 
(Meaning: The Johnstons permanently reside in San Diego.)
Present progressive	
The Johnstons are living in San Diego.
(Meaning: The Johnstons are staying in San Diego at the moment, but it is not their 
permanent residence.)
Here is a second example with the verb store:
Present tense	
We store all of our equipment in a warehouse. 
(Meaning: We always keep our equipment in a warehouse.)
Present progressive	
We are storing all of our equipment in a  
	
	
  warehouse. 
(Meaning: We are temporarily keeping our equipment in a warehouse.)
As you can see, when we change the tense of the verb from the present tense to the present pro-
gressive tense, the implicit time frame of the sentence also changes from unlimited to limited or 
temporary; that is, it becomes time bound.
As we have seen in this subsection on the use of the present progressive tense to 
express action in progress, the present progressive describes actions that span a period of 
time. Some nonnative speakers apparently think of this span of time as being equivalent to 
the “timeless” nature of tenses such as the present tense, which also describes action that 
spans across time. Accordingly, nonnative speakers assume that the present progressive 
tense, as with the present tense, is compatible with stative verbs. The difference is that the 
present progressive has a somewhat unusual self-limiting time frame that makes the pres-
ent progressive time bound and therefore incompatible with the basic timeless meaning of 
stative verbs.
The key, then, for avoiding the highly persistent error of using stative verbs in the present 
progressive tense is twofold: (1) clearly understanding the odd way that the present progressive 
uses a self-limiting time frame, and (2) knowing how to reliably recognize stative verbs. This pre-
sentation suggested two specific features of stative verbs to be aware of: by far the most important 
is the different relationship between verb and subject. Stative verbs describe their subjects. 
Dynamic verbs carry out the actions that their subjects ­perform. The second feature of stative 
verbs is the incompatibility of stative verbs with most adverbs of time. Determining whether 
adverbs of time can be used with a verb is a helpful way of testing to see whether the verb is a 
timeless stative verb or a time-bound dynamic verb.

The past  
progressive tense
The past progressive tense consists of the helping verb be in a past tense form 
followed by a verb in the present participle –ing form. Here are some examples:
We were driving downtown when the storm hit.
The train was just pulling into the station when we got there.
We were thinking about going out for dinner.
I was thinking I might go camping this weekend.
I was talking to Janet yesterday, and she told me that you were retiring.
We were working on that project all morning!
Major use of the past progressive tense
The major function of the past progressive tense is very much like the basic func-
tion of the present progressive tense: to talk about something that takes place (i.e., 
“progresses”) over some span of time—present time for the present progressive, 
past time for the past progressive. There are also a number of other, more idiom-
atic uses of the past progressive that we will discuss at the end of the chapter.
Another important point of similarity between the two tenses is that the past 
progressive (as with the present progressive) can be used only with dynamic verbs. 
(Chapter 10 has a detailed explanation of why.) Dynamic verbs are verbs whose 
action takes place in real time (as opposed to the inherently timeless nature of 
stative verbs). Consequently, dynamic verbs are compatible with the time-bound 
meaning of the past progressive tense. For example, notice that all of the examples 
of the past progressive given at the beginning of this chapter are dynamic verbs.
By the same token, the timeless nature of stative verbs makes them incom-
patible with the time-bound meaning of the past perfect tense. (Please see 
Chapter 1 if you need to review the characteristics of dynamic and stative verbs.) 
For example, the verb like is a typical stative verb that describes an ongoing state 
or condition. We cannot use this stative verb in the past progressive tense:
X  I was always liking homemade ice cream.


Both the past tense and the past progressive describe actions that took place in past time. 
The difference between the two is that the past tense treats the past-time action as a finished 
event—completely over and done with—whereas the past progressive treats the past-time action 
as an ongoing process that continues through some span of past time. For example, compare the 
following sentences:
Past tense	
Fred mowed the lawn this afternoon.  
	
	
  (event)
Past progressive	
Fred was mowing the lawn this afternoon.  
	
	
  (process)
The past tense sentence describes an action that was completed in the past. The past progressive 
sentence describes an action that was in process during the time frame of the sentence. We have 
no way of knowing whether or not Fred ever finished mowing the lawn. The past progressive

As we have seen, the past progressive functions much as does the present progressive in that 
they both describe actions in progress. There is, however, one way in which the two types of pro-
gressive tenses are not the same, especially when they use verbs with a strong sentence of action.
	
The past progressive tense 	 153
Compare the following examples of present progressive and past progressive sentences. 
Assume that there is no previous mention of these sentences, that is, you are seeing each sentence 
for the first time:
Present progressive	
My parents are traveling in India.
Past progressive	
My parents were traveling in India.
The present progressive sentence seems perfectly normal. However, the past progressive sentence 
as it stands seems unfinished or inconclusive in a way the present progressive sentence does not.
The difference is in the time of the action. Sentences in the present progressive tense take 
place in a time that is automatically defined: now—at the present moment of time. We always 
know when sentences in the present progressive tense take place: they take place now.
Sentences in the past progressive, however, are different. There is nothing that automatically 
defines when they took place in the past unless the producers of the sentences provide that infor-
mation for us. That is why the example sentence about traveling in India seems incomplete in the 
past progressive. We have no way to place the trip to India in past time.
To make the sentence seem complete, we need to add what is called a “temporal frame.” A tem-
poral frame is an adverbial time expression that locates the action of the sentence in past time—either 
by providing a point in time or a span of time during which the action took place. Here are some 
examples of the same sentence with the temporal frame added (in italics):
My parents were traveling in India recently.
My parents were traveling in India during my junior year.
My parents were traveling in India when the attack in Mumbai happened.
The sentences with the temporal frame added now seem complete and perfectly normal. Note 
that the three examples of temporal frames use all three different types of adverbials:
Recently is an adverb.
During my junior year is an adverb prepositional phrase.
When the attack in Mumbai happened is an adverb clause.
All temporal frames are adverbials of time—adverbs, adverb prepositional phrases, or 
adverb clauses. Adverbials of time (as with most other adverbials) typically follow the verb in 
what is called normal order. One of the defining characteristics of adverbials of time (again, as 
with most adverbials) is that they can be moved to the beginning of the sentence in what is called 
inverted order. Here are the three example sentences again, both in normal order and in inverted 
order:
Adverb
Normal order	
My parents were traveling in India  
	
	
	
recently.
Inverted order	
Recently my parents were traveling in

Note that when an adverb clause is inverted, that is, the adverb clause is moved from its 
normal place following the main clause to a position in front of the main clause, the inverted 
adverb clause is set off with a comma. Unlike in British English where the use of commas with 
inverted adverb clauses is optional, in American English the commas are obligatory.

Each of the following sentences is in the past progressive tense. Each sentence contains an 
adverbial of time that functions as a temporal frame for that sentence. Underline the entire 
temporal frame. Confirm that your answer is correct by moving the entire temporal frame 
adverbial to the beginning of the sentence. (Remember, if you invert an adverb clause, be 
sure to use a comma.) The first sentence is done as an example.
A film crew was shooting a commercial in front of our building all morning.
answer:	
A film crew was shooting a commercial in front of our building all

Sentences with adverb clauses can be quite confusing. One thing that makes them confus-
ing, as we have seen, is that the main clause and the adverb clause can be in either order; for 
example:
The teams were already playing by the time we got to the stadium.
main clause	
	
	
     adverb clause
By the time we got to the stadium, the teams were already playing.
adverb clause	
	
	
      main clause
There is a second reason why sentences with adverb clauses can be confusing. So far, all of 
our examples with adverb clauses have had the past perfect verb tense in the main clause and the 
temporal frame in the adverb clause. However, there is no grammatical requirement that the past 
perfect verb tense be in the main clause. It can be (and often is) in the adverb clause; for example:
I got interested in Asian art when I was living in San Francisco.
main clause	
	
	
     adverb clause
And, of course, to add to the confusion, the adverb clause with the past progressive tense can 
also be inverted; for example:
When I was living in San Francisco, I got interested in Asian art.
adverb clause	
	
	
    main clause

EXERCISE
This is a different type of exercise that mimics the options we have when we actually form 
real sentences. Each of the following sentences consists of two clauses, the first labeled 
“main clause” and the second labeled “adverb clause.” Follow these steps to create two 
versions of the same sentence:
 
Step 1: Identify and underline the two verbs that make up the past progressive tense (hint: 
they can be in either clause).
 
Step 2: Attach the adverb clause to the end of the main clause to create a complete 
sentence with the adverb clause in the normal position following the main clause.
 
Step 3: Form an inverted version of the same sentence by attaching the adverb clause to 
the beginning of the sentence (hint: check the punctuation).
 
The first sentence is done as an example.
Main clause: I was just getting into the shower
Adverb clause: When the phone rang

The future progressive tense
The future progressive tense consists of the helping verb be in its future tense form will be fol-
lowed by a verb in the present participle –ing form. Here are some examples:
We will be staying with some friends in Los Angeles.
I will be waiting for you in the baggage claim area.
The painters will be finishing up the kitchen tomorrow.
The storm will be hitting the coast around midnight.
Everyone will be watching the big game.
I’ll be loading the car while you check out of the motel.
Major use of the future progressive tense
The basic meaning of the future progressive tense is to talk about something that is expected to 
take place (i.e., “progresses”) over some span of future time. There are also four other, more idi-
omatic uses of the future progressive tense that we will discuss at the end of the chapter.
The future progressive tense, as with the other two progressive tenses, can generally be used 
only with dynamic verbs and not with stative verbs.
Strangely enough, there is a special and quite limited use of the future progressive tense that 
does permit it to be used with some stative verbs. We will ignore this highly restricted use of the 
future progressive until we get to the discussion of idiomatic uses at the end of the chapter.

Here are some examples of the future progressive using both types of verbs:
Dynamic verbs
The fish will be biting after all this rain.
I’ll be working downstairs if you need me.
It will be snowing all afternoon.
Stative verbs
X  You will be loving your new kitchen when it is finished.
X  They will be agreeing with you.
X  I am afraid that it will be costing more than we can afford.
8·5
EXERCISE
All of the following sentences are in the future progressive tense. If the sentence uses a 
dynamic verb, write “OK” and put “Dynamic” above the verb. If the sentence uses a stative 
verb, write “X,” draw a line through the stative verb, and write “Stative” above the verb. The 
first two sentences are done as examples.
They will be discussing the agreement for hours yet.
                                                Dynamic
answer:

                          Stative
answer: 	
X  He will be belonging to a fraternity when he is in college.
	 1.	 I will be seeing about it and let you know what I find out.
	 2.	 The electrician will be rewiring the kitchen on Monday.
	 3.	 Their children will be looking just like them.
	 4.	 They will not be minding it if we park in their driveway.
	 5.	 The committee will be counting votes tomorrow.
	 6.	 The team will be deserving its reputation if they can win today.
	 7.	 The kids will be playing on the swings all afternoon.
	 8.	 The dinner will not be including dessert or beverage.
	 9.	 The company will be expanding its online information system.
10.	 Ruth will be playing tennis this afternoon with some of her friends.
The future progressive is like the past progressive in one important way: the need to define 
when the action takes place by adding what is called a “temporal frame” to the sentence. (See 
Chapter 11 for a detailed discussion of temporal frames.) For example:
My parents will be visiting us.
	
The past progressive tense 	 159
This sentence seems incomplete without giving more information about the visit, either when the 
visit will take place (time) or how long the visit will be (duration). When we revise the sentence 
by adding a temporal frame (in italics), the sentence seems complete:
My parents will be visiting us after Christmas. (time)
My parents will be visiting us for a couple of days. (duration)
Temporal frames are always adverbials of time or duration; they can be adverbs, adverb 
prepositional phrases, or adverb clauses. Here is an example of each type in italics:
We will be backpacking in the Sierras next week. (adverb)
We will be backpacking in the Sierras during spring break. (adverb prepositional phrase)
We will be backpacking in the Sierras while we are on vacation. (adverb clause)
All of these adverbials of time and duration share the characteristic that they can be moved 
from their normal position at the end of the sentence to an inverted position at the beginning of 
the sentence; for example:
Next week, we will be backpacking in the Sierras.
During spring break, we will be backpacking in the Sierras.
While we are on vacation, we will be backpacking in the Sierras.
Note that the inverted adverb clause is followed by a comma. The use of commas with inverted 
adverb clauses is obligatory in American English.

Both the future tense and the future progressive are used to describe an action that will take 
place in future time, but the two tenses look at the future action in two very different ways: the 
future tense describes the action as a unitary event that happens at a single point in future time. 
The future progressive tense, however, is used to emphasize that the future action is a process that 
occurs across a span or period of future time; for example:
Future tense	
We will host a reception for the sales force  
	
	
	
tomorrow.
Future progressive tense	
We will be hosting a reception for the sales  
	
	
   force tomorrow.
Even if the two sentences are talking about the same reception, the two tenses look at it in two 
different ways: the future tense sentence sees the reception as a single event (as opposed to all 
other possible events or not doing an event at all); the future progressive tense sees the reception 
as a process or sustained action that takes place across a period of time.

The perfect progressive tenses
The perfect progressive tenses are a combination of one of the three perfect tenses (past perfect, 
present perfect, future perfect) with the progressive tense.
The perfect tenses consist of the helping verb have (in some form: present, past, or future) 
followed by a verb in the past participle form. In the following examples, the verb fade is in the 
past participle form.
Present perfect	
The carpet has faded near the windows.
Past perfect	
The carpet had faded near the windows.
Future perfect	
The carpet will have faded near the windows.
The progressive tense consists of the helping verb be in some form followed by a verb in the 
present participle form; for example:
They are celebrating his birthday today.
When we combine the perfect and the progressive tenses, the perfect tense portion of the 
sentence consists of have (in one of its three forms) followed by been (the past participle form of 
be). Been plays a double role. In addition to being the past participle verb form required to form 
the perfect tense, been is at the same time the helping verb be required to form the progressive 
tense. For example: 
I have been working in the garden all morning.
In this present perfect progressive sentence, we can see that been is linked with the verb in front 
of it (have) to form the perfect tense, and it is linked with the verb following it (working) to form 
the progressive tense. We might imagine the two roles of been as being played by two separate 
superimposed verbs, one been forming the present perfect tense with have and the other been 
forming the progressive tense with working:
have been	
forms the present perfect portion of the  
	
	
	
sentence
been working	
forms the progressive portion of the  
	
	
	
sentence 
	
162	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
There are three different forms that the perfect progressive can take depending on the form 
that the verb have takes: present, past, or future. Here is an example of each:
Present perfect progressive	
They have been protesting against the new  
	
	
	
taxes.
Past perfect progressive	
They had been protesting against the new  
	
	
	
taxes.
Future perfect progressive	
They will have been protesting against the  
	
	
	
new taxes.

Each of the following items contains a grammatically correct sentence in one of the three 
forms of the perfect progressive. Underline all of the verbs that make up the perfect 
progressive tense and identify which type of perfect progressive tense it is: present perfect 
progressive, past perfect progressive, or future perfect progressive. The first sentence is done 
as an example.
She has been introducing all the speakers at the main sessions.
answer: 	
She has been introducing all the speakers at the main sessions.
present perfect progressive
	 1.	 He had been scoring nearly half of the team’s goals.
	 2.	 The painters will have been stripping off all the old paint.
	 3.	 They had been washing all the dishes by hand during the power outage.
	 4.	 I have been smelling gasoline for days.
	 5.	 She will have been studying English since she was in elementary school.
	 6.	 Fortunately, I had been keeping a good record of all our building expenses.
	 7.	 The wild pigs had been reproducing at a rapid rate.
	 8.	 Apparently, they have been posing as reporters.
	 9.	 She will have been administering the fund for more than 20 years.
10.	 The doctor has been prescribing an antifungal drug for me.
The perfect progressive tenses, as with the other progressive tenses, cannot be used with 
stative verbs. Here are examples for the three perfect progressive tenses using the stative verbs 
own, like, understand, and sound:
Present perfect progressive
X  Roberta has been owning several sailing boats.
X  I have always been liking working in the garden.
X  The children have all been understanding what to do in case of fire.
X  The idea of a fall vacation has always been sounding like fun.
Past perfect progressive
X  Roberta had been owning several sailing boats.
X  I had always been liking working in the garden.
X  The children had all been understanding what to do in case of fire.
X  The idea of a fall vacation had always been sounding like fun.

verb. The first two sentences are done as examples.

	 4.	 They were warned that they had been exceeding their budget.
	 5.	 He had been recognizing some old friends.
	 6.	 I’m afraid that I have been lacking enough money to do it.
	 7.	 They have certainly been putting up with a lot lately.
	 8.	 Henry had been loving pistachio ice cream ever since he was a child.
	 9.	 My old suits had been fitting me again after I had lost all that weight.
10.	 The government had been exerting a lot of pressure on them to reform.
We will now turn to a detailed examination of the three types of perfect progressive tenses.
Present perfect progressive
The present perfect progressive consists of a present tense form of the helping verb have (has or 
have) followed by been and the main verb in the present participle form (–ing). Here are some 
examples:
I have been thinking about what you said.
They have been working on this project for weeks now.
She has been exhibiting her work in galleries all over the world.
The head office has really been interfering with our day-to-day operations lately.
It has been snowing for hours.
	
164	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
The basic function of the present perfect progressive tense is to describe an action or condi-
tion that began in the past and has continued in an unbroken manner up to the present time and 
may continue on into the future; for example:
Their family has been making wine for five generations.
This definition of the present perfect progressive is virtually the same as the definition of the 
present perfect tense, and, indeed, with verbs that describe ongoing action, the two tenses can be 
quite similar in meaning; for example:
Present perfect progressive	
The kids have been watching TV all  
	
	
	
afternoon.
Present perfect	
The kids have watched TV all afternoon.
There is, however, something of a difference in emphasis between the two sentences. The present 
perfect progressive sentence emphasizes the ongoing duration of the TV watching more than 
does the present perfect sentence.
We can see a real difference between the two tenses quite clearly with most action verbs; for 
example:
Present perfect progressive	
I have been repairing the gear shift on  
	
	
	
my bike.
Present perfect	
I have repaired the gear shift on my bike.
The present perfect progressive sentence describes a work still in progress, while in the present 
perfect sentence, the job has already been completed. In general, present perfect progressive 
senses always place a strong emphasis on a process being carried out over time. Present perfect 
sentences, on the other hand, may or may not imply action in process.

	 8.	 The company start a new internship program you might be interested in.

	 9.	 Remind me who he is. I forgot his name.

10.	 It seems as though it rain forever.

The present perfect progressive tense also resembles its other parent, the present progressive. 
For example, compare the following two sentences:
Present perfect progressive	
 We have been remodeling our kitchen.
Present progressive	
We are remodeling our kitchen.
At first glance, there does not seem to be any real difference between the two tenses. Both sen-
tences describe an action (remodeling the kitchen) that is taking place over a span of present time.
The difference is in how the two tenses treat the meaning of “present time.” For the present 
progressive, “present time” is nothing more or less than the present moment of time; it is an end-
less “now.” The present moment of time is dimensionless: there is no earlier or later. There is no 
starting the remodeling process in the past; there is no movement across time to the completion 
of the remodeling project. The present progressive treats time as an indivisible, unitary block.
The present perfect progressive treats time in a different manner. It emphasizes that the 
action of the verb continues over a span of time up to the present moment.
A particularly striking demonstration of the “timeless” nature of the present progressive 
tense is the fact that we cannot use adverbs of time that imply duration for the simple reason that 
there is no duration in present progressive tense sentences. Look what happens when we attempt 
to add an adverbial of duration (in italics) to our example sentence:
X  We are remodeling our kitchen for the past two weeks.
X  We are remodeling our kitchen recently.
X  We are remodeling our kitchen ever since the tree fell on it.
X  We are remodeling our kitchen since last week.
These same adverbials of duration are perfectly grammatical with our example present 
perfect progressive sentence:
We have been remodeling our kitchen for the past two weeks.
We have been remodeling our kitchen recently.
We have been remodeling our kitchen ever since the tree fell on it.
We have been remodeling our kitchen since last week.
Past progressives and be
When you refer to a past action, state, or event that is incomplete or in progress, use the past 
progressive.

Past state: I was feeling fine ten minutes ago.
Past event: Something strange was ­happening.

A specific time reference is often used with the past progressive. This reference is generally a 
prepositional phrase or another clause with a simple-past verb ­form.
Prepositional phrase: By 5:00, all the participants were packing their ­bags.
Clause: While I was preparing breakfast, I heard the news on the ­radio.
When you want to indicate two simultaneous ongoing actions, use the past progressive for ­both.
Simultaneous actions: While I was preparing breakfast, I was listening to the ­news.
The past progressive consists of the auxiliary verb be and the -ing form of the main verb. The 
auxiliary verb is marked for ­tense.

When a one-syllable word or a word with a stressed final syllable ends in a single consonant 
sound, double the last letter before adding ­-ing.
One-syllable word: swim ➞ ­swimming
Word ending in a stressed syllable: permit ➞ ­permitting

Past perfect ­progressive
When you want to refer to an action, a state, or an event that originated prior to another time in 
the past but is still ongoing or incomplete, use the past perfect ­progressive.
Ongoing state: I had been having frequent headaches, so I decided to visit a ­doctor.
Incomplete action: We had been making plans when someone interrupted us. 
You can also use the past perfect progressive to refer to a hypothetical action or ­event.
Hypothetical action: If they had been paying attention, they would have found the ­clues.
Sentences such as this one will be discussed in more detail in Part IV.
	
The past progressive tense 	 169
The past perfect progressive consists of two auxiliary verbs, have and be, and the -ing form 
of the main verb. The auxiliary verb had comes first, and it is marked for ­tense.
Next comes the perfect/passive form of the verb be—been. The final element of the past per-
fect progressive is the -ing form of the main ­verb.

Forming ­contractions
Contractions are often formed by combining pronouns and the auxiliary verb had or by combin-
ing the auxiliary verb had and not. You will often hear these contractions in conversation or see 
them in informal writing, but you will rarely find them used in formal ­contexts.
Notice that an apostrophe indicates that at least one letter is omitted:
I’d been going	
I ­hadn’t been ­going
You’d been going	
You ­hadn’t been ­going
He’d been going

Forming contractions: pronouns  
with the auxiliary verb will
In English, verbs are often combined with other words to form contractions. These shortened 
forms include an apostrophe (’) to indicate missing letters. It is important to learn contractions 
because you will often hear them in conversation or see them in informal writing. Formal writ-
ing, though, rarely contains ­contractions.
The modal auxiliary verb will is often combined with a pronoun to form a contraction. 
Notice that an apostrophe indicates that the letters w and i are omitted:
I + will = I’ll	
we + will = ­we’ll
he + will = he’ll	
you + will = ­you’ll
she + will = she’ll	
they + will = ­they’ll
it + will = ­it’ll

Future ­perfect
Use the future perfect when you want to refer to a future action, state, or event that will be com-
pleted by a specific time in the ­future.
Future action: By next week, she will have completed the ­course.
Future state: In 2020, we will have known each other for twenty ­years.
Future event: The ship will have sunk by ­then.
The future perfect consists of the modal auxiliary verb will, the auxiliary verb have, and the 
perfect/passive form of the main verb. The perfect/passive verb form is used to indicate either the 
perfect aspect or the passive voice. (The passive voice will be discussed in Part IV.) The perfect/
passive form for regular verbs consists of the base form of the verb and the ending -ed.

Forming ­contractions
Contractions are often formed by combining pronouns and the auxiliary verb will or by combin-
ing the auxiliary verb will and not. You will often hear these contractions in conversation or see 
them in informal writing, but you will rarely find them used in formal ­contexts.
Remember that an apostrophe indicates that at least one letter is omitted and that the letter 
i in will changes to o in the negative contraction ­won’t:
I’ll have been going	
I won’t have been ­going
You’ll have been going	
You won’t have been ­going
He’ll have been going	
He won’t have been ­going

Passive voice
The passive voice is a structure that allows you to make a statement without 
knowing who performed the action of the sentence: The house was destroyed. Or 
the person who performed the action is placed in a passive position in the sen-
tence: The house was destroyed by soldiers.
An active sentence is commonly structured subject + verb + direct object. 
A passive sentence changes that structure to direct object used as the subject + to 
be + past participle + by + subject used as the object of the preposition. Let’s com-
pare the two structures:
Active Sentences	
Passive Sentences
Kim finds the dog.	
The dog is found by Kim.
We buy his car.	
His car is bought by us.
The girls stole the purse.	
The purse was stolen by the girls.
They solved the problem.	
The problem was solved by them.
The verb to be in the passive sentences is conjugated in the same tense as the 
verb in the active sentences. Look how the various tenses appear in the passive:
Tense	
Passive Sentences
Present	
The house is destroyed by the soldiers.
Past	 	
The house was destroyed by the soldiers.
Present Perfect	
The house has been destroyed by the 
soldiers.
Past Perfect	
The house had been destroyed by the  
soldiers.
Future	
The house will be destroyed by the soldiers.
Future Perfect	
The house will have been destroyed by the 
soldiers.
Only in the present and past tenses is there a difference between the habitual 
form of the conjugation and the conjugation for an action in progress or 
incomplete:
the house is destroyed/the house is being destroyed
the house was destroyed/the house was being destroyed

When a sentence is changed from active to passive, the tense of the active sentence is ­retained 
in the passive sentence.
Patrick paints a picture.	
A picture is painted by Patrick.
Samantha is teaching the class.	
The class is being taught by Samantha.
Robin borrowed a dollar.	
A dollar was borrowed by Robin.
Tyler has seen this episode.	
This episode has been seen by Tyler.
Alicia will prepare a salad.	
A salad will be prepared by Alicia.
Rewrite each active sentence as a passive sentence, retaining the tense of the original 
sentence.
1.	 Maria found a hundred dollars.
	
2.	 The students will memorize the Preamble to the Constitution.
	
3.	 Did you purchase the tickets?
	
4.	 They have discovered some ancient ruins.
	
5.	 Bill is measuring the room.
	
Sentences that cannot be written in the passive voice
Only transitive verbs—verbs followed by an object—can be used in the passive. It is not possible 
to use intransitive verbs, such as happen, sleep, come, go, live, occur, rain, rise, depart, walk, and 
seem, in the passive.

Forming the passive voice without a by phrase
The passive voice is often used when it is unimportant to know who or what performs the action. 
In the sentence “Coffee is grown in Colombia,” we are informed where coffee is grown. Yet the 
coffee could be grown by villagers, by children, by immigrants, or by any other group of people. 
Following are examples that illustrate the most common ways of using the passive voice without 
a prepositional phrase introduced with by.
Rice is grown throughout Asia.
That car was built in the 1930s.
This watch was imported from Geneva, Switzerland.
Poor Mr. Lowry is going to be fired!
When the subject of an active sentence is some vague entity (they, someone, people), it is 
common to avoid using a by phrase in the passive.
active	
They cultivate grapes in southern France.
passive	
Grapes are cultivated in southern France.
By is used in the passive when it is important to inform the reader or listener who is respon-
sible for the action: “Perfume was written by Patrick Süskind.” In this case, it is important to 
know that a specific author (and not just any author) wrote this particular book.
As a general rule, if the writer knows who performs the action, it’s preferable to use the 
active voice: “My neighbor made the strawberry pie.” Stylistically, the writer could use the pas-
sive, but it would mean that he or she is trying to direct the reader’s attention to the new subject: 
“The strawberry pie was made by my neighbor.”

The stative passive
Past participles in a passive-voice sentence can act like adjectives, in the sense that they describe 
a noun.
The car is old.
The car is locked.
In the first example, the word old is an adjective and describes car. In the ­second example, 
locked is a past participle; it functions as an adjective and also ­describes car.
Essentially, the participle is derived from passive-voice sentences like the following.
The car has been locked by someone.  (The car is locked.)
The window was repaired by someone.  (The window is repaired.)
Adjectives and participles
The passive past participle can be used to describe an existing state or situation; when it does, it 
is called the stative passive. Consider the following examples.
I locked the car door five minutes ago. Now the car door is locked.
Peter broke the window two days ago. Now the window is broken.
We were without water for a week. Now the pipe is finally fixed.
In all three examples, the action took place earlier, as described in the first sentence, and the state 
of that action in the present is expressed in the second sentence of each pair. In these second sen-
tences, the past participle functions as an adjective.
Notice that there is no by phrase in any of the sentences. However, the stative passive is often 
followed by prepositions other than by.
She is satisfied with her job.
Marc is married to Vanessa.
There are many other common adjectives in English that are, in reality, stative passive 
structures.
	
Passive voice	 197
Frank is interested. I’m bored.
The store was closed. He saw nothing but closed stores.
The work was finished. He took the finished work home.
Following is a list of commonly used adjectives that are derived from present and past 
participles.
amazing/amazed
boring/bored
confusing/confused
disappointing/disappointed
exciting/excited
exhausting/exhausted
frightening/frightened
interesting/interested
satisfying/satisfied
surprising/surprised
terrifying/terrified
tiring/tired
The present participle is used as a modifier for the active voice. The past participle is used as 
a modifier for the passive voice.
The athlete was amazing.  (This adjective describes what the athlete is.)
The athlete was amazed.  (This adjective describes what happened to the athlete.)
This book is boring.  (This adjective describes what the book is.)
This student is bored.  (This adjective describes what happened to the student.)

You already know that adjectives modify nouns. For example: the blue house, our 
little brother, a silly poem. Adverbs are also modifiers, but they modify verbs, 
adjectives, and other adverbs. You can easily identify adverbs because most end in 
-ly: happily, quickly, slowly, beautifully. 
Most adjectives can be changed to an adverb by adding -ly to the end of the 
adjective. If the adjective ends in -y, change the -y to -i and then add -ly.

bad	 	
badly
bright

There are a few adjectives and adverbs that have special forms and uses. One 
important one is good. If good means “kind,” it is only used as an adjective. Use 
kindly in place of it as an adverb. If good means “talented,” use well as its adverb. 
Careful! If well means “healthy,” it is not an adverb; it is an adjective.
good = kind: He is a good man. 
He spoke to us kindly.
good = talented: Hayley is a good tennis player. 
Hayley plays tennis well.
well = healthy: I am glad that your father is well again.
There is only one form for the word fast. It is both an adjective and an adverb:
Lee is a fast talker. (adjective)
Lee talks fast. (adverb)
And note that the adverb home does not end in -ly:
We went home after work.
You can also identify adverbs by asking certain questions of the verb in a 
sentence. Ask how, where, or when. The answer is an adverb.
Adverbs
	
200	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
How? Where? When?	
The Answer = Adverb
Jamal got quickly to his feet.
“How did Jamal get to his feet?”	
quickly
She went home on the bus.
“Where did she go on the bus?”	
home
They arrived punctually.
“When did they arrive?”	
punctually
Some adverbs of time, which answer the question when, do not always end in -ly. Consider 
these words: today, tomorrow, yesterday, tonight, late, early, never.
Certain adverbs, which often do not end in -ly, qualify the degree of the meaning of an adjec-
tive or adverb: quite, rather, very, somewhat, too:
somewhat slowly = the slowness is not great but evident
rather slowly = the slowness is emphasized, but it is not extreme
quite slowly = the slowness is emphasized here
very slowly = the slowness is extreme
too slowly = the slowness is more than desired
Let’s look at how adverbs can modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs:

A primary function of adverbs is to modify verbs. Many adverbs are formed by adding the suffix 
-ly to adjectives: quick ~ quickly, happy ~ happily, careful ~ ­carefully, bitter ~ bitterly.
She swims quickly.
He opened the window carefully.
Adverbs can also modify adjectives, thereby augmenting their meaning.
They are extremely sad.
The crowd soon became rather unruly.
Several adverbs express time, for example, tomorrow, today, never, soon, yesterday, yet.
My parents are supposed to arrive tomorrow.
Will you be off the phone soon?
Has Jimmy taken his shower yet?
Some adverbs can be placed in the middle of a sentence, and they generally have a set posi-
tion there. Mid-sentence adverbs stand in front of verbs in the simple present and simple past 
tenses. They follow forms of be in simple present and simple past tenses, and they stand between 
an auxiliary verb and a main verb.
before simple present and past tenses
We seldom have dessert after dinner.
My brother often spent his free time playing his guitar.
I rarely talk on the phone for more than a few minutes.
Tom frequently asks an embarrassing question.
following simple present and past tenses of be
Anna is always there on time.
Bill was sometimes late for an appointment.
Her husband is never around when she needs him.
The children are apparently in very good health.
between an auxiliary verb and main verb
John can never face his parents again.
Anna has always gotten there on time.
They have often traveled abroad.
Do you regularly shop in this store?
The word well can be used as an adverb or as an adjective. As an adverb, well means “in a 
good manner” or “capably” and describes how someone does something. As an adjective, well 
means “healthy.”

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They can be individual words, phrases, or 
clauses.

Adverbs	 203
Adverb types and forms
There is more than one type of adverb. This chapter provides you with information on adverbs of 
manner, time, frequency, degree, and place, as well as adverbs that provide a comment on a 
situation.
Individual adverbs are formed simply by adding the suffix -ly to an adjective. Naturally, the 
English rules of spelling apply; for example, a final y is changed to i when an adverb is formed 
(happy → happily). Let’s look at some example adjectives and their adverbial formation:
adjective	
adverb
careful	
carefully
quick	
quickly
simple	
simply
A few adverbs are identical to their adjectival counterparts. For example:
adjective	
adverb
early	
early
fast	
fast
late	
late
Adjectives that describe certain increments of time look like adverbs but are true adjectives. 
For example:
We’re paid on an hourly basis.
I take a daily vitamin supplement.
Grandma has a weekly appointment with her doctor.
Your monthly salary is going to be increased.
My yearly physical exam always makes me nervous.
Still other adjectives that look like adverbs are not related to the ones that describe incre-
ments of time. Examples are deadly, early, lively, and only.
When an adverb is used in the comparative or superlative, the suffix -ly is generally not 
added. However, if the comparative and superlative are formed with more and most, the suffix 
-ly is added.
positive	
comparative	
superlative
quickly	
quicker	
(the) quickest
softly	
softer	
(the) softest
well	
better	
(the) best
awkwardly	
more awkwardly	
most awkwardly
beautifully	
more beautifully	
most beautifully
carefully	
more carefully	
most carefully
Don’t confuse late with lately. Both are adverbs, but they have different meanings.
The girls arrived late.	
the opposite of early
He’s been rather moody lately.

Adverbs of manner
Adverbs of manner form a large category. They tell how something is done. Consider the follow-
ing sentences:
Martin drove slowly.	
How did he drive? Slowly.
I carefully removed the battery.	
How did I remove the battery? Carefully.
She kissed the baby gently.	
How did she kiss the baby? Gently.
Adverbs of manner can be individual words or phrases. Let’s look at some of these:
individual words	
phrases 
badly	
in anger
politely	
with a sly grin 
sarcastically	
with great sadness 
Adverbs of manner tend to follow the predicate of a sentence.
subject + predicate + adverb of manner
Bill + spoke to her + angrily.
The team played badly.
He tried to speak politely.
She gave them the news with great sadness.
Tom began to shout in anger.
Adverbs of time
Adverbs such as now, still, yesterday, just, finally, and Sunday tell when something occurred. 
These adverbs of time are part of a category that includes individual words, phrases, and clauses. 
For example:
individual words	
phrases	
clauses
finally 	
during the exam	
after the game ended
recently 	
in the spring 	
I got on the bus 
today	
on Monday before	
since she arrived here 
Adverbs of time can introduce a sentence or follow it.
subject + predicate + adverb of time
He + left for work + at seven.
adverb of time + subject + predicate
At seven + he + left for work.
Recently, I bought a new laptop.

Adverbs	 207
Adverbs of frequency
Adverbs of frequency tell how often something occurs. They can be individual words or phrases. 
For example: 
individual words	
phrases
never 	
at times
sometimes	
in the rarest of moments 
usually	
with great frequency 
When an adverb of frequency is an individual word, it tends to stand just before the verb. If 
it is a phrase, it usually can either introduce the sentence or follow it. Let’s look at some example 
sentences:
We rarely stay out very late.
My sister often invites her friends over to listen to music.
At times, I just want to drop everything and go out.
Mr. Johnson showed up at our door with great regularity.
Adverbs of degree
Adverbs of degree tell to what extent something is done. Some of the most commonly used adverbs 
of degree are listed here:
adequately	
perfectly
almost	
practically
entirely	
profoundly
extremely	
really
greatly	
strongly
highly	
totally
hugely	
tremendously
immensely	
very
moderately	
virtually	
partially
The adverbs in this category are used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. The posi-
tion of the adverb in a sentence is determined by the word it modifies:
	 Verbs
The children enjoyed the circus immensely.
The lawyer strongly advocated suing the company.
	 Adjectives
She was an extremely beautiful woman.
Bill had become profoundly depressed.
	 Adverbs
They sang really badly.
The project was progressing moderately well.

Adverbs that make a comment
Some adverbs make a comment on a situation. They identify the speaker’s or writer’s viewpoint or 
opinion on the subject matter of a sentence. Some commonly used comment or viewpoint adverbs 
follow:
bravely	
presumably
carelessly	
seriously
certainly	
simply
clearly	
stupidly
cleverly	
surely
confidentially	
technically
definitely	
theoretically
disappointingly	
thoughtfully
foolishly	
truthfully
generously	
unbelievably
happily	
undoubtedly
kindly	
(un)fortunately
naturally	
(un)luckily
obviously	
wisely
personally	
wrongly
When adverbs of this category are used in context, they show the degree to which the speaker 
or writer agrees or disagrees with a statement. These adverbs can also show disapproval or skepti-
cism. Let’s look at some example sentences:
She clearly has no understanding of 	
The speaker has doubts about her 
the topic. 	
	
understanding.
	
Adverbs	 211
Theoretically, the project should be 	
The speaker is skeptical that the completion 
completed by May. 	
	
date can be met.
Wisely, he chose to drop out of the 	
The speaker believes the decision to drop out 
competition. 	
	
was a good one.
Some adverbs of this type are placed only at the beginning of the sentence. For example:
Confidentially, I think that Martha is being dishonest.
Presumably, the storm is going to let up and we’ll be able to leave.
Happily, the child was found unharmed.
Certain of these adverbs can either introduce the sentence or follow the subject. For example:
Naturally, I thought I had done the right thing.
I naturally thought I had done the right thing.
Certainly, Jean understands why you can’t go tonight.
Jean certainly understands why you can’t go tonight.
Personally, I believe the election came off quite smoothly.
I personally believe that the election came off quite smoothly.
Be careful with the adverb happily. It is both an adverb of manner and an adverb of view-
point or comment. If it tells how something is done, it is an adverb of manner.
Tina spoke happily about her engagement.
If it expresses a point of view, suggesting that the subject matter of the sentence is good 
news, then the adverb is one of viewpoint or comment.
Happily, the man found his wallet and could buy the tickets.

Adverb placement in a sentence
Adverbs tend to be placed in a specific position in a sentence. This is merely a tendency, however, 
and some adverbs are more flexible and make sense in more than one position. In some cases, the 
position of an adverb in a sentence is determined by what element is stressed or by the actual 
function of the adverb. Also, some adverbs can be used in more than one way. For example:
Disappointingly, Mark received another 	 adverb of viewpoint introducing the sentence 
bad grade.
Bill disappointingly missed making 	
adverb of viewpoint following the subject 
a goal.
She gave a disappointingly weak 	
adverb of degree modifying an adjective 
response.
Following are some general rules for determining adverb placement in a sentence: 
	 Adverbs of manner, adverbs of time, and adverbs of place stand after the verb or the pre-
dicative expression at the end of the sentence.
subject + verb + manner/time/place
The boys stared glumly at the scoreboard.	
adverb of manner
They’ll arrive in town next week.	
adverb of time
Phillip stood near the door.	
adverb of place
	 Adverbs of frequency are placed before the main verb in a sentence.
subject + frequency + verb
Jack often visits us when he’s in town.
She rarely spoke of life in her village. 
An exception is that if the sentence contains an auxiliary verb, an adverb of 
frequency usually follows that auxiliary.
Maria has never been to Canada.
My dad will usually cry at a sad movie.
You should regularly floss your teeth.
Also, if the verb to be is used as the main verb of a clause, an adverb of frequency 
will follow that verb.
She was seldom in class.
You are always the best musician in the orchestra.
	
Adverbs	 213
	 Adverbs of degree follow the verb or verb phrase they modify—but if they modify an 
adjective or another adverb, they are placed before them.
The good news about Dad’s health pleased	
modified verb 
	 them tremendously.
He had a profoundly infected wound.	
modified adjective
They had to drive really slowly.	
modified adverb
	 Adverbs of viewpoint or comment commonly begin the sentence—though, some can 
follow the subject. For example:
viewpoint + subject + verb
Wisely, they left the stalled car and walked to town.
Undoubtedly, you have no confidence in yourself.
subject + viewpoint + verb
She clearly has no intention of paying me back.
Bob obviously overslept again.
The explanations of adverb placement in this chapter have been qualified by words such as 
commonly used or tendency, because there can be exceptions to the rules. The rules are not finite.
One frequent exception to the rules is the placement of an adverb at the beginning of a sen-
tence, rather than in its normal position, for emphasis. For example:
Now you finally come up with an answer to my question!
Rarely do I ever watch such television programs!
Sometimes I think about my days back on the farm.

Plurals
Most English plurals are formed quite simply. Just add -s to the end of a noun:
dog ➞ ­dogs
building ➞ ­buildings
However, if the noun ends in -s, -ss, -z, -x, -ch, or -sh, add -es to form the plural:
boss ➞ ­bosses
box ➞ ­boxes
witch ➞ ­witches
dish ➞ ­dishes 
If the noun ends in a consonant plus -y, change the -y to -i, then add -es: 
lady ➞ ­ladies
penny ➞ ­pennies
Words that end in -o are a special problem. Some form their plural by adding -s, 
and others form their plural by adding -es. Look at these examples:
Singular	
Plural + -s	
Singular	
Plural + -es
auto	
autos	
potato	
potatoes
piano	
pianos	
hero	
heroes
alto	
altos	
echo	
echoes
zoo	
zoos	
veto	
vetoes
solo	
solos	
cargo	
cargoes
Consult a dictionary to know precisely which plural ending to use with words that 
end in -o.
There are a few words that form the plural with an -s ending but also require 
a consonant change in which f changes to v:
knife ➞ knives
leaf ➞ leaves
shelf ➞ shelves
wife ➞ wives
wolf ➞ wolves
	
Plurals	 219
Certain other nouns form their plural in completely irregular ways. Fortunately, the list is 
quite brief:
child ➞ children
mouse ➞ mice
foot ➞ feet
person ➞ people (or persons)
goose ➞ geese
deer ➞ deer [no change!]
man ➞ men
woman ➞ women
tooth ➞ teeth
ox ➞ oxen
Write the plural form of the following words.
	 1.	 house 
	 2.	 wife 
	 3.	 ox 
	 4.	 fox 
	 5.	 tooth 

Punctuation
The period is a commonly used signal that a sentence has ended. It is used after 
two types of sentences: (1) the declarative sentence, which is a statement about 
something, and (2) the imperative sentence, which is a request or command:
Statement: I have five dollars in my pocket.
Command: Give me the five dollars that you have in your pocket.
The period is also used after an abbreviation. Some abbreviations are titles: Mr., 
Mrs., Ms., Dr., Rev. Others are short versions of specific expressions: A.M., P.M., 
and so on. If you end a sentence with one of these abbreviations, do not add a 
second period. For example:
Phillip arrived at exactly 8:00 P.M.
The question mark at the end of a sentence signals that the sentence is asking a 
question. You already know how to position verbs to form a question. Some 
examples:
Statement	
Question
Carlotta is at home.	
Is Carlotta at home?
You have a problem.	
Do you have a problem?
They were in Rome.	
Were they in Rome?
The exclamation point at the end of a sentence signals that the information in the 
sentence is stated strongly or with emotion. Some ordinary statements and excla-
mations look identical. But if the sentence ends in an exclamation point, it is 
expressed with emotion:
Ordinary Statement	
Strong Statement
Jason is sick.	
Jason is sick!
I saw a stranger there.	
I saw a stranger there!
It has started to snow.	
It has started to snow!
He ­didn’t leave.	
He didn’t leave!

The comma is the signal in the middle of a sentence that ideas are being separated. This can be 
done to avoid confusing the ideas or to separate things in a list. For example, compare the sen-
tence “When he came in the house was cold.” to “When he came in, the house was cold.” You do 
not mean that “he came in the house.” There are two ideas here in two clauses. They are separated 
by a comma: (1) He came in. (2) The house was cold.
As an example of a list, consider the sentence “He bought pop, tarts, and candy.” If you omit 
the comma after pop, someone might think that he bought pop tarts.
In a list, there should be a comma after every item until you use the word and: a boy, a girl, 
two dogs, and a cat. Some English writers prefer to omit the comma before and.
I need paint, brushes, a yardstick, and some tape.
OR
I need paint, brushes, a yardstick and some tape.
Commas are also used to separate the name of a person to whom an imperative or a question is 
directed:
Janelle, call Mr. Montoya on the telephone.
Dr. Gillespie, will my husband be all right?
Boys, try to be a little quieter.
They are also often needed to separate two or more adjectives that modify a noun:
She wore a red, woolen jacket.
The tall, muscular man was a weightlifter.
You should use a comma to separate two independent clauses combined as a compound 
sentence. They are most often combined with these conjunctions: and, but, for, not, or, so, and yet. 
	
Punctuation	 223
An independent clause is one that has a subject and predicate and makes sense when it stands 
alone. Some examples:
DeWitt is baking a cake, and Allison is preparing the roast.
Do you want to go to a movie, or should we just stay home?
It began to rain hard, yet they continued on the hike.
You should separate exclamations and common expressions from the rest of the sentence 
with a comma:
Oh, I can’t believe you said that!
No, I don’t live in Germany anymore.
Yes, you can go outside now.
Well, you really look beautiful tonight. 
By the way, my mother is coming for a visit.
A comma is required to separate the day of the week from the date, and the day of the month 
from the year. The comma is omitted if only the month and year are given.
He arrived here on Monday, June 1st.
My birthday is January 8, 1989.
The war ended in May 1945.
A decimal point looks like a period. In some languages, a decimal amount is separated by a 
comma: 6,25 or 95,75. But in American English, a decimal amount is separated by a period 
(a decimal point): 6.25 or 95.75.
In long numbers, amounts of thousands are separated by a comma in English. In other lan-
guages, they are often separated by a decimal point or by leaving a space:
English Numbers	
Numbers in Other Languages
1,550,600	
1.550.600 or 1 550 600
22,000,000	
22.000.000 or 22 000 000

The semicolon is a punctuation mark that is similar to both a comma and a period. It sig-
nals that there is a pause between ideas, and those ideas are closely linked. It often combines two 
related independent clauses into one sentence:

The apostrophe is also used to form possessives. To make the meaning of a singular noun 
possessive, add -’s. For plural nouns that end in an -s, just add the apostrophe. All other plurals 
will end in -’s.
Noun	
Possessive Form 	
Meaning
boy	
the boy’s dog	
the dog that belongs to the boy
boys	
the boys’ games	
the games that belong to the boys
house	
the house’s roof	
the roof of the house
Tom	
Tom’s aunt	
an aunt of Tom’s
book	
a book’s pages	
the pages of a book
men	
the men’s work	
the work that the men do
If a word ends in an -s, you can add -’s to form the possessive when the pronunciation of the 
word requires another syllable in the possessive:
Lois ➞ Lois’s
Thomas ➞ Thomas’s
actress ➞ actress’s
If another syllable is not pronounced to form the possessive, just add an apostrophe; this 
tends to be the case in the plural:
actresses ➞ actresses’
railings ➞ railings’
classes ➞ classes’
It is common to use an apostrophe to form the plural of abbreviations: two Dr.’s, three M.D.’s, 
four Ph.D.’s. The same is true when forming the plural of a number or letter: “You had better 
mind your p’s and q’s.”

To review, punctuation is used to make text easier to read and to convey clear and specific meaning. 
It is used to divide words into grammatical units, like clauses within sentences. Punctuation marks 
consist of a set of standardized symbols: periods, commas, semicolons, colons, question marks, 
exclamation points, apostrophes, quotation marks, hyphens and dashes, and parentheses and brack-
ets. The proper use of these symbols is governed by grammatical and stylistic guidelines.

The colon
A colon connects clauses that are closely linked in meaning or topic. Typically, the second clause 
continues or develops the thought of the first clause, or it contains an illustration or explanation 
of a topic in the first clause. If a complete sentence follows a colon, the first word of that sentence 
should be capitalized.

The apostrophe
An apostrophe is used in one of two ways: to form a contraction (a shortened version of two 
words) or to express possession. Following are some common English contractions.
cannot ➝ can’t
do not ➝ don’t
it is ➝ it’s
what is ➝ what’s
who is ➝ who’s
In the same way that the apostrophe is used to replace letters that have been omitted, it can 
also be used to indicate that numbers have been omitted.
1990 ➝ ’90
2008 ➝ ’08
The following examples illustrate the use of the apostrophe to express possession.
Damien’s car is really fast.
Rosie’s roses are so pretty.
The roller skates are Helen’s.

The hyphen and the dash
A hyphen is used to divide or syllabify words at the end of a line when the word runs over to the 
beginning of the next line. It also connects individual words to form a compound word.
Hyphens cannot be used to divide one-syllable words: thought, through, weight, and so on. 
Hyphens can be used to divide words of two or more syllables.
fun-damental
funda-mental
fundamen-tal

If a word already contains a hyphen, it is generally syllabified using that hyphen.
a mid-life crisis
a cross-cultural conference
A number of everyday words and expressions are hyphenated: U.S. Social Security numbers 
(666-86-3454), telephone numbers (555-342-4536), and certain compound nouns (two-step) and 
adjectives (two-way). Following are examples of hyphenated everyday words.
hard-driving
long-winded

pitch-dark

When dividing words at the end of a line, leave at least two letters at the end of the line 
and bring at least three letters down to the beginning of the next line.
A dash interrupts the flow of a sentence and sets a separate thought off from the rest of a sentence.
If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, use the two Bs method—back off and breathe

Infinitives and gerunds
You have already discovered infinitives and how they are used as verbs. But infin-
itives can be used in other ways as well.
They can be used as nouns: To run would be cowardly. (subject of the 
sentence)
They can be used as adverbs: We came here to thank you. (why we came)
They can be used as adjectives: He is the man to trust. (modifies man)
Gerunds look like present participles: a verb plus an -ing ending (running, looking, 
buying, etc.). But gerunds are different from present participles. Present participles 
are used to form an action in progress or incomplete: I was running, she is speak-
ing, they are helping. And as a participle they can be used as adjectives. But a ger-
und is used as a noun. Look at these examples:
Present Participle

Gerund and infinitive complements
Gerunds and infinitives are verb forms, but they are not used as the main verbs in sentences. 
Gerunds are formed by adding -ing to the base form of a verb: running, talking, doing. (The -ing 
form is often called the present participle.) Infinitives consist of two parts: the infinitive marker to 
and the base form of a verb: to run, to talk, to do. Gerunds and infinitives can follow main ­verbs.
She enjoys playing the ­guitar.
He promised to sing for us.
Some verbs, such as enjoy, are followed by gerunds. Others, such as promise, are followed by 
infinitives. But some verbs can be followed by either gerunds or ­infinitives.
I like reading ­mysteries.
I like to read ­mysteries.
Generally, gerunds signal that an action has happened or is especially vivid. Infinitives indi-
cate future or hypothetical ­events.
Using gerunds
Gerunds have four ­forms:
Simple: She avoids driving during rush ­hour.
Perfect: He admits having taken the ­documents.
Passive: They dislike always being put in the last row.
Passive perfect: I appreciate having been given this ­opportunity.

Gerunds or ­infinitives
Some verbs can be followed by either gerunds or infinitives. Sometimes there is no significant 
difference in meaning between a sentence with a gerund and a sentence with an ­infinitive.
He began ­humming.
He began to hum.
The most common verbs falling into this category are the following three verbs dealing with 
time:
begin	
continue	
start
The verb stop, however, is used to express two different ­meanings.
We stopped singing. [The singing has ­ended.]
We stopped to sing. [The singing has not started ­yet.]
After verbs dealing with emotion, the gerund is generally used to express the vividness of an 
action, an event, or a state or to indicate its actual occurrence. The infinitive usually indicates a 
future, potential, or hypothetical action, event, or ­state.
I usually prefer cooking my own food, but tonight I would prefer to go out.
The following verbs fall into this ­category:
hate	
like	
love	
prefer
Some verbs dealing with memory signal different time sequences, depending on whether a 
gerund or an infinitive is ­used.
I remember locking the door. [The door was locked; then the action of locking was 
­remembered.]
I remembered to lock the door. [The remembering of a responsibility took place before the 
action of locking was ­performed.]

More on gerunds
Gerunds are verb forms that function as nouns. They are formed by adding the suffix -ing to the 
base form of the verb: talking, running, building, developing, and so on.
Gerunds can function as subjects or objects.
gerund as subject
Working has never been John’s strong point.
Swimming is really great exercise.

Distinguishing gerunds from present participles
Although gerunds look like present participles, they function in a different way. Present partici-
ples are typically part of a progressive verb phrase and follow the auxiliary verb be. Gerunds are 
only used as nouns.
present participles
She was cooking and cleaning all day long.  (past progressive)
Tom and Marie have been jogging for over an hour.  (present perfect progressive)
gerunds
Jogging is always healthy.  (subject)
Dad had to do the cooking and cleaning by himself.  (direct object)

Relative pronouns
Relative pronouns are used to link two sentences that have the same noun or 
pronoun in them. Relative pronouns form the beginning of a relative clause. In 
English there are five basic relative pronoun forms:
that = used when referring to either an animate or inanimate noun
who = used when referring to an animate noun
which = used when referring to an inanimate noun
whose = used as a possessive
elliptical relative pronoun = occurs when the relative pronoun is omitted
The noun in the introductory clause is called the antecedent. A relative pro-
noun replaces the noun in the second clause—the relative clause.
Let’s look at how relative pronouns connect two sentences. If the same noun 
or pronoun is found in both sentences, the second one can be omitted and replaced 
by a relative pronoun. Then the two sentences are stated as one. Notice how the 
animate and inanimate nouns change to relative pronouns.
Two Sentences: He likes the girl. The girl comes from Alaska.
Relative Clause: He likes the girl who comes from Alaska. OR 
He likes the girl that comes from Alaska.
Two Sentences: I bought the car. The car needs repairs.
Relative Clause: I bought the car that needs repairs. OR 
I bought the car, which needs repairs.
Nouns can be used as subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, objects of 
prepositions, and possessives; so, too, can relative pronouns that replace them. 
There are specific uses for that, who, and which; however, in casual speech 
the relative pronoun that can be substituted for who or which except when the 
relative pronoun shows possession. Look at these examples with inanimate nouns:

soldier.
Careful! If whom or which is part of a prepositional phrase, the preposition can stand in 
front of whom or which, or it can stand at the end of the relative clause:
I like the man for whom I work.
I like the man whom I work for.
These are the books about which she spoke.
These are the books, which she spoke about.
When the relative pronoun is that, the preposition always stands at the end of the relative clause:
I like the man that I work for.
These are the books that she spoke about.
When an indirect object noun is changed to a relative pronoun, the preposition to or for 
should be added to give the meaning of the original sentence. Examples:
Do you know the man? I gave the man ten dollars.
Do you know the man to whom I gave ten dollars?
Andre saw the girl. I bought the girl some flowers.
Andre saw the girl that I bought some flowers for.
If the relative pronoun is used as a direct object or object of a preposition, it can be omitted. It is 
then called elliptical. If a preposition is involved, it must stand at the end of the relative clause.
Usage	
Relative Pronoun Used	
Elliptical Relative Pronoun
direct object

Where’s the car she was sitting in?
Note: You should be aware that in casual speech many English speakers regularly substitute who for 
whom.
	
Relative pronouns	 251
There are two types of relative clauses: restrictive clauses and nonrestrictive clauses. Restric-
tive relative clauses contain information that is essential to the meaning of the sentence. If that 
information is omitted, the sentence cannot be understood as intended. The restrictive relative 
clause identifies the person or thing talked about in the other clause. Here are two examples:
The woman who stole the ring was soon arrested. (who stole the ring is essential information)
What’s the make of the car that you bought? (that you bought is essential information)
Nonrestrictive relative clauses merely give additional information but do not define the per-
son or thing talked about in the other clause. The relative pronoun that should not be used in 
nonrestrictive relative clauses. However, in casual speech there is often substitution between that 
and the relative pronouns who and which. Here are two examples of nonrestrictive clauses:
The mayor, who is out of town right now, will give a speech on Friday. (who is out of town 
right now is additional but nonessential information)
The play, which lasted over three hours, was given rave reviews. (which lasted over three hours 
is additional but nonessential information)
Commas are used to separate a nonrestrictive relative clause from the other clause in the ­sentence.

Using relative pronouns
To review, two sentences can be combined by using a relative pronoun. If the same noun appears 
in two sentences, one of the nouns can be changed to a relative pronoun and the two sentences 
can be stated as one, the one with the relative pronoun being called a relative ­clause.
He likes the car. His father bought the car. = He likes the car that his father ­bought.
The English relative pronouns are:
who, whom, whose → used to replace animate ­nouns
which → used to replace inanimate ­nouns
that → used to replace animate or inanimate ­nouns
	
254	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
In casual speech whom is almost always replaced by who.
There is also an elliptical relative pronoun form, which omits the use of a relative pronoun 
­entirely.
Relative pronoun that: He likes the car that his father ­bought.
Elliptical form: He likes the car his father ­bought.
Although there are some traditional rules for choosing between that and the forms of who 
and which, in casual speech they are often used ­interchangeably:
This is the man that I told you ­about.
This is the man who I told you ­about.
The general rule for more formal usage requires using that if the relative clause is restrictive. 
A restrictive relative clause is one that defines or identifies the antecedent (the word to which the 
relative pronoun refers). Look at this ­example:
The house that his grandfather built many years ago burned down last ­night.
The relative clause (in bold type) identifies which house burned down last night. The sen-
tence would not have the same meaning if the relative clause were omitted. The meaning of house 
is restricted by the information provided in the relative ­clause.
The relative pronouns who and which tend to be used in relative clauses that provide nones-
sential information. Nonrestrictive clauses are set off by commas. The meaning of the original 
sentence is not affected by such relative ­clauses:
Our mayor, who has been in office for two years, is traveling to ­Canada.
Some articles, which appeared in newspapers across the country, ridiculed the ­mayor.
In these nonrestrictive relative clauses, the mayor and the articles are not identified by the 
relative clauses. They do not answer the questions, Which mayor? Which articles? The sentences 
make complete sense when the relative clauses are ­omitted:
Our mayor is traveling to ­Canada.
Some articles ridiculed the ­mayor.
When changing a noun to a relative pronoun, the function of the noun must remain the 
function of the relative pronoun: subject, direct object, indirect object, object of a preposition, or 
possessive. Here are some examples that use the sentence, The boxer was the ­champ:
Subject: The boxer won the bout. → The boxer that won the bout was the ­champ.
Direct object: He knocked out the boxer. → The boxer that he knocked out was the ­champ.
Object of preposition: I spoke with the boxer. → The boxer that I spoke with was the ­champ.
Possession: The boxer’s training was best. → The boxer whose training was best was the 
­champ.
If a noun is used as an indirect object, the relative pronoun becomes the object of the prepo-
sition to or for in the relative ­clause:
Indirect object: I gave the boxer some good advice. → The boxer that I gave some good 
advice to was the ­champ.
When the relative pronoun is that and is the object of a preposition, the preposition must 
stand at the end of the ­clause:
We found the scientist that Professor Jones had written ­about.
	
Relative pronouns	 255
If the relative pronoun is who(m) or which, the preposition will stand before the relative 
pronoun in formal style but at the end of the clause in more casual style. Notice again that non-
restrictive relative clauses are separated by ­commas:
Formal: It was a terrible event, about which much had been ­written.
Casual: It was a terrible event, which much had been written ­about.
Formal: The criminal, from whom they received several threats, was finally ­located.
Casual: The criminal, who they received several threats from, was finally ­located.
Use whose for the possessive of an animate. Use of which or whose for the possessive of an 
­inanimate:
They visited their grandfather, whose farm is located in ­Maryland.
She bought a dreadful hat, the color of which was ­green.
She bought a dreadful hat, whose color was ­green.
The elliptical form of a relative clause occurs when the relative pronoun is a direct object or 
the object of a preposition. Look at these ­examples:
Direct object: They spoke with the thief that the police arrested ­yesterday.
Elliptical form: They spoke with the thief the police arrested ­yesterday.
Object of preposition: I found the document that you inquired ­about.
Elliptical form: I found the document you inquired ­about.
In the elliptical form of a relative pronoun used as the object of a preposition, the preposition 
is always at the end of the ­clause.

Reflexive pronouns
Reflexive pronouns reflect back to the subject of a sentence. The English reflexive 
pronouns are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and 
themselves. Each one can only be used with its personal pronoun counterpart 
when that personal pronoun is the subject of the sentence:
Personal	
Reflexive 	
A Sample  
Pronoun	
Pronoun	
Sentence
I	
myself	
I hurt myself again.
you	
yourself	
You can do it yourself.
he

He enjoyed himself.
she

She helped herself to some candy.

It destroyed itself in a few seconds.
we	
ourselves	
We found ourselves in a strange city.
you	
yourselves	
You must clean yourselves up before dinner.
they	
themselves	
They accidentally burned themselves.
If the reflexive pronoun and the personal pronoun are not counterparts, then 
personal pronouns should be used in the sentence. Look at these examples:
Counterparts	
Not Counterparts
I hurt myself again.	
I hurt him again. I hurt them again.
He enjoyed himself.	
He enjoyed it. He enjoyed them.
They harmed themselves.	
They harmed me. They harmed her.
Remember that third-person singular and plural nouns will use the appro-
priate third-person singular and plural reflexive pronouns:
Marta bought herself a new car.
The boy cut himself.
The alien creature wounded itself with its own claws.
The men helped themselves to some beer.

Using reflexive pronouns
To review, the personal pronouns have a form that is used when that form is in the objective case 
and is the counterpart of its personal pronoun. That form is called a reflexive pronoun. The reflex-
ive pronouns look like ­this:
Subject Pronoun	
Object Pronoun	
Reflexive ­Pronoun
I	 	
me	
myself
you (singular)	
you	
yourself
he

it

itself
we	
us	
ourselves
you (plural)	
you	
yourselves
they	
them	
themselves
one	
one	
oneself
If the subject pronoun and the object pronoun refer to the same person, you should use the 
reflexive pronoun counterpart in the sentence. If the object pronoun refers to someone or some-
thing else, use its object pronoun ­form:
I suddenly saw myself in the mirror. (counterpart of I)
I suddenly saw him in the mirror. (different ­person)
We sometimes have to help ourselves. (counterpart of we)
We sometimes have to help them. (different ­persons)

Reciprocal pronouns
There are only two reciprocal pronouns: each other and one another. They are never used as the 
subject of a sentence, and they always refer to a plural antecedent. Their use is similar to how a 
reflexive pronoun is used, but they refer back to two or more persons or things in a plural ante-
cedent. Look at these ­examples:
Maria helps Tom. Tom helps Maria. → Maria and Tom help one ­another. 
or Maria and Tom help each ­other.
He loves her. She loves him. → They love one ­another. 
or They love each ­other.
Two boys spoke with five girls. → They spoke with one ­another. 
or They spoke with each ­other.

my lesson, your lesson = one another’s ­lesson.

Possession
Nouns form the possessive in two ways: (1) they become the object of the preposi-
tion of, or (2) they add the ending -’s (apostrophe plus -s). Look at these examples:
the roar of a lion	
a lion’s roar
the color of the book	
the book’s color
the children of Mrs. Diaz	
Mrs. Diaz’s children
the prey of the wolves 	
the wolves’ prey
(See Unit 12 regarding punctuation to review the rules for using the apostrophe.)
The possessive is used to show to whom or to what something belongs: 
This is Ginny’s car.
The kittens of an alley cat have a hard life.

Possessive pronouns
Possessive pronouns are sometimes called possessive adjectives. No matter what you call them, 
their use is clear and simple. Just like reflexive pronouns, possessive pronouns have personal pro-
noun counterparts. Look at this table of pronouns to see the relationship:
Subject	
Object	
Possessive 1	
Possessive 2
I	 	
me	
my	
mine
you	
you	
your

he

his
she	
her	
her	
hers
it	 	
it	
its

we	
us	
our	
ours
they	
them	
their	
theirs
There is a difference in the use of the possessive pronouns 1 and 2. The possessive pronoun 1 
always stands before a noun and modifies it. The possessive pronoun 2 replaces a possessive pro-
noun 1 and a noun, when the noun is understood. Look at these examples:
My gift is unusual.	
Which gift is mine? (my gift)
Is this your brother?	
The seat on the right will be yours. (your seat)
Our friends live here.	
These two dogs are ours. (our dogs)
His aunt is a doctor.	
His is a doctor. (his aunt)
Her dress is very nice.	
Hers is very nice. (her dress)
Possessive pronouns tell to whom or to what something belongs.

Possessive pronouns
Just as nouns can be formed to show ownership or possession, so too can pronouns. Most nouns 
add an apostrophe plus an -s to show possession: John’s car, the woman’s dress, a winter’s night. 
But pronouns form a completely new word. The following chart shows each subject pronoun and 
its possessive ­form.
Subject	
Possessive	
Possessive  
Pronoun	
Pronoun 1	
Pronoun ­2
I

his, her, ­its
we	
our	
ours
you ­(plural)	
your	
yours
they	
their	
theirs
who

whose
A possessive pronoun 1 is used to modify a noun. It is always used in a combination of the 
possessive pronoun and a noun or noun phrase. It shows to whom something ­belongs:
I have books. = my ­books
You have a car. = your car
We have money. = our ­money
Who has a funny hat? = whose funny hat
The third person possessive pronouns are used to replace possessive ­nouns:
the young man’s wallet = his ­wallet
our daughter’s party = her ­party
the roach’s nest = its nest
my friends’ new house = their new ­house
There is a difference in the use of the possessive pronoun 1 and 2. The possessive pronoun 2 
replaces a possessive pronoun 1 and a noun when the noun is ­understood.
This is my glove. = This is ­mine.
Where is your car? = Where is ­yours?
That was his dinner. = That was his.
Her dog is smarter. = Hers is ­smarter.
Did you meet our friends? = Did you meet ­ours?

Prepositions
A preposition connects a certain word in a sentence to a noun or pronoun. But 
the meaning of prepositional phrases (preposition followed by a noun or pronoun) 
is varied. They tell where, when, why, how, or whose. Look at these examples:
where = in the garden
when = until Monday
why = because of the bad weather
how = by train
whose = of the bride
Here is a list of some commonly used prepositions.
about	
behind	
for	
since
above	
below	
from	
through
across	
beside	
in	
to
after	
between	
of	
under
along	
by	
off	
until
around	
despite	
on	
up
at		
down	
out	
with
before	
during	
over	
without
Compound prepositions consist of more than one word: along with, because 
of, due to, in spite of, on account of, next to, on top of, together with, and so on.
When a noun is used in a prepositional phrase, it does not change. But most 
pronouns do:
I → with me	
we → from us
you → to you	
they → for them
he → by him	
the boys → to the boys
she → without her 	
a girl → after a girl
it → on it	
my keys → over my keys

	 9.	 The letter from my parents made me very happy.
	10.	 In spite of all her problems, Tonya went on smiling.
Note: Sometimes a prepositional phrase connected to the subject of a sentence can cause 
confusion. This is especially true when one of those elements is singular and the other is plural. 
Always remember that the subject—not the prepositional phrase—determines the form of the 
verb.
Singular Subject + Plural Object of the Preposition
The box of fresh cookies was torn open by their dog.
Each of you has a duty to help them.
One of the youngest candidates needs a lot more money.
Plural Subject + Singular Object of the Preposition
The musicians in the little band were given a new contract.

Using prepositions
Prepositional phrases are formed using a preposition and its object (a noun or a pronoun). 
Prepositional phrases describe the relationship between the object of the preposition and another 
element of a sentence. In general, prepositional phrases describe relationships of place, time, and 
ownership.
The dog is hiding under the car.
They only rented that apartment for a month.
The back door of my house is painted blue.

Compound prepositions
A compound preposition functions as a single preposition, but is composed of more than one 
word. Just like other prepositions, a compound preposition is followed by a noun or pronoun 
object.
Following is a list of common compound prepositions.

Whether simple or compound, prepositions function the same in sentences.
	
Prepositions	 273
The preposition between expresses a choice involving two people or things, while the preposition 
among expresses a choice involving more than two people or things.

Noun and pronoun objects
The object of a prepositional phrase can be either a noun or a pronoun. In most cases, when a 
noun is replaced by a pronoun, the pronoun must be of the same number and gender as the noun.
Ms. Harper spoke of her son quite often.
Ms. Harper spoke of him quite often.
He sat on the old mare and looked out over the valley.
He sat on her and looked out over the valley.
In spite of the impending storm, they set off for the park.
In spite of it, they set off for the park.
She never received the gift from Tom and me.
She never received the gift from us.
He danced with the same two girls all evening.
He danced with them all evening.
However, if a prepositional phrase introduced by in indicates a location, a pronoun object 
sometimes cannot replace a noun object. Instead, it is more common to use an adverb, such as 
here or there. This is particularly true of cities and large regions.
She loved living in Washington, D.C.
She loved living there.
We haven’t been in this town for very long.
We haven’t been here for very long.
Compare the examples above with those below.
The woman sat comfortably in a comfy chair.
The woman sat comfortably in it.
Richard found 50 dollars in the little box.
Richard found 50 dollars in it.
Something similar occurs with the preposition of when it shows possession and, on occa-
sion, with the preposition by. Although pronoun objects are quite acceptable following of and by, 
there is a tendency to use a possessive pronoun in place of the prepositional phrase.
The color of the blouse is bright red.
Its color is bright red.
The roar of the huge lion gave me chills.
Its roar gave me chills.
The quality of his poems and short stories was highly regarded.

Although each of these sentences could have contained a prepositional phrase with a pro-
noun object, the tendency is to use a possessive pronoun instead of a prepositional phrase.

Their raid on the house was unwarranted.

More than one prepositional phrase
Sentences are not limited to one prepositional phrase. Indeed, a series of prepositional phrases 
can occur in one sentence.
Look in the attic in a little box on the floor behind that old mattress.
Each prepositional phrase in this example gives further information about where to look.
Where should I look?	
in the attic
Where in the attic?	
behind that old mattress
Where behind the mattress?	
on the floor
Where on the floor?	
in a little box
Naturally, you cannot connect random prepositional phrases to form a sentence. They must 
make sense together and provide further information. Consider what might logically follow the 
prepositional phrases in these examples.

Prepositions	 277
Prepositions that indicate location
Location can be thought of as the area, point, or surface of something. Certain prepositions indi-
cate those locations. Here are some of the most commonly used ­ones:
above	
in back of
along	
in front of
among	
in the middle ­of
at		
near
behind	
next ­to
below	
on
beside	
over
between	
under
in		
with
Most of these prepositions make sense in the same sentence, because they all indicate 
­location:
The boy is at the ­table.
The boy is behind the ­table.
The boy is beside the ­table.
The boy is next to the ­table.
The boy is under the ­table.
Besides the verb to be, which is frequently used to show location, there are several other 
verbs that also indicate where someone or something is:
to be found	
to ­remain
to be located	
to sit
to be situated	
to ­stand
to lie	
to stay
to live
Of course, there are many other such verbs. Those in the preceding list are among the ones 
used frequently. Look at these ­examples:
Is Guadalajara located in the east or ­west?
The center of the earthquake was situated near Los ­Angeles.
Shells like this can be found along the banks of the ­river.
John sits in front of me.
The girl was lying on a cot and ­resting.
A stranger stood next to us.
I have to remain at my workbench until ­noon.
You can stay with me.
We live between two large ­houses.
As long as you know the meaning of the prepositions, you can use them with relative accu-
racy. But in English, just like in all other languages, certain prepositions can only be used with 
certain verbs or phrases. And even if two or more prepositions can be used with the same phrase, 
there is a change in meaning—even if it’s only a slight ­change.
Let’s look at the prepositions at and in. They are used quite commonly and have a meaning 
that is easy to understand. In most cases, at is used to show that someone or something is posi-
tioned next to a horizontal or vertical ­surface:
at the table	
at the door
at the computer	
at the ­window
at the desk	
at the ­blackboard
	
278

The preposition in indicates that someone or something is located inside ­something:
in the car	
in the city
in the house	
in the box
in the garden	
in the ­center
These two prepositions, while having very distinct uses in a sentence, are also often used 
with the same phrases. But when they are, the meanings are ­different.
Use at to show that someone is at the location of his or her occupation, preoccupation, or 
some ­activity:
at school	
at the store	
at the ­hospital
at the movies	
at the library	
at the ­factory
With certain phrases, in can also be ­used:
in school	
in the store	
in the ­hospital
in the movies	
in the library	
in the ­factory
Notice the difference in meaning between the two ­prepositions:
at school = Someone is on the campus of the school, perhaps inside the building, or 
perhaps outside the building. This person is probably a student or teacher: “The chemistry 
teacher was at school until 7:00 ­p.m.”
in school = Someone is inside the school building. This person is probably a student or 
teacher: “The injured student was in school again ­today.”
Take note of yet another difference of meaning when the definite article the is added to the 
­phrase:
at the school = Someone is on the campus of the school, perhaps inside the building, or 
perhaps outside the building. This person is not necessarily a student or teacher: “The 
landscaper was at the school to plant some new ­shrubs.”
in the school = Someone is inside the school building. This person is not necessarily a 
student or teacher: “My father was in the school for a ­meeting.”
There are several phrases that omit the definite article the when the preposition at is involved. 
Such phrases indicate that someone is involved in the activity described in the ­phrase:
He’s at work. = He is ­working.
They’re at church. = They’re attending a religious ­ceremony.
The children are at play. = The children are ­playing.
She’s at home. = She is staying in her ­house.
Tom’s at lunch. = Tom is eating lunch. (also used with breakfast, dinner, and ­supper)
He’s at class. = He is attending a ­class.
In general, at indicates that someone is involved in an activity at a location. In says that 
someone is inside that ­location:
The students are at school. (They are on campus ­somewhere.)
The students are in school. (They are in the building in their ­classes.)
Father is at the hospital. (Father is visiting. Or he may be a doctor or ­nurse.)
Father is in the hospital. (Father is a patient. Or he was outside. Now he’s ­inside.)
Maria is at the factory. (She probably works ­there.)
Maria is in the factory. (She was outside. Now she’s ­inside.)
	
Prepositions	 279
Mom is at the store. (She is shopping there. Or perhaps she works ­there.)
Mom is in the store. (She was outside. Now she’s ­inside.)
Be sure to distinguish between the prepositions among and between. Use among to say that 
you are in the company of more than just two people. Use between to say that you are in the com-
pany of only two ­people:
He sat among the members of the tribe and told them ­stories.
My sister sat between Jim and me.
Another pair of prepositions is often used to show “by means of what transportation” a per-
son travels. It is common to use the preposition by to show the concept of traveling in a convey-
ance: I went by car. We travel by plane. They go by train. But in and on are also often used to show 
location on the forms of ­transportation:
We were in the car ready to leave for ­vacation.
They’re on a train somewhere in ­Oregon.
What bus were you on?
Haven’t you ever been on a plane ­before?

Prepositions	 281
Prepositions that indicate movement or direction
The prepositions in this category do not suggest where someone or something is located. Instead, 
they describe someone’s or something’s movement or direction. Below is a list of some commonly 
used prepositions for this ­concept:
along	
off
at		
on
by		
onto
from	
out ­of
in		
to
into	
toward(s)
There are two forms of this preposition: toward and towards. Both are ­acceptable.
Certain verbs tell you that a preposition is being used to show location: to be, to be located, 
to sit, and many more. Certain other verbs tell you that a preposition is being used to show move-
ment or direction. Here are some important ­ones:
to come	
to ­journey
to drive	
to jump
to fall	
to ­return
to fly	
to run
to go	
to ­travel
to hurry	
to walk
Just like prepositions that show location, a variety of prepositions that show movement or 
direction can be used in the same ­sentence. The basic sentence remains the same, but the preposi-
tion alters the kind of movement or direction involved. Look at these example ­sentences:
The women walked along the ­river.
The women walked from the ­river.
The women walked into the ­river.
The women walked out of the ­river.
The women walked to the ­river.
The women walked toward the ­river.
You need to be aware of the difference between to and toward. The preposition to says that 
someone is going in the direction of a place and will arrive there ­soon:
John is going to the ­park.
The preposition toward means that someone is going in the direction of a place but may 
decide to change ­direction:
John is going toward the park. (But he may decide to turn left and go to the bank ­instead.)
The prepositions in and on are used to show location. But they are also used to show move-
ment or direction. Traditionally, only into and onto are used to show movement or direction, but 
many people today use in and on in place of ­them:
She runs into the house.	
She runs in the ­house.
He fell onto the floor.	
He fell on the ­floor.
If you consider the phrase She runs in the house literally, it means that a girl is inside a house 
and running. But English speakers know what is meant by this sentence from the context of the 
conversation where that sentence was used. So in casual speech you will hear both in and into and 
on and onto used ­interchangeably.

Prepositions that indicate time
There are several prepositions that are used in expressions of ­time:
after	
from
at		
in
before	
on
by		
since
during	
to
for	
until
These prepositions are used with a variety of moments in time and in phrases that answer 
the question when. Some, such as at, on, in and for, have a limited use.
The preposition at is used primarily to point out an event in time or a time shown on a ­clock:
at dawn, at dusk, at daybreak, at holiday time, at lunchtime, at ­midnight, at the end of the 
day, at 4:30 p.m., at 11:55 a.m.
The soldiers finally got back at ­dawn.
On is used primarily with days of the week and ­dates:
on Monday, on Tuesday, on Wednesday, on Thursday, on Friday, on Saturday, on Sunday, on 
June twelfth, on the fifteenth of May
We’re starting a new project on the first of the ­month.
Use in for a nonspecific time of a day, of a month, of a year, or of a ­season:
in the morning, in January, in 2001, in ­summer
We like going camping in ­autumn.
	
284

Use for with a specific event in ­time:
for Christmas, for the holidays, for your birthday party, for the ­celebration
I’ll be there for your baby’s ­christening.
Most other prepositions can be used in many varied expressions of ­time:
She can be here by five ­o’clock.
I want to speak with you before the end of the day.
He works every day from dawn to ­dusk.
The drought has continued since last ­June.
We spend a lot of time in Mexico during the winter ­months.
Tom won’t come home until next ­year.
Maria went out to dinner after work ­yesterday.
From and to are usually used in the same sentence to show a long period of time. Until often 
replaces to:
He worked here from 1997 to ­2002.
She’ll be in Europe from June until ­August.

Compound ­prepositions
When two or more words are strung together and end with to, of, or sometimes from, they are 
called compound prepositions. They function like all other prepositions. The only difference is 
that they are composed of more than a single word. Here is a list of the compound ­prepositions:

Prepositions that combine with other ­words
Adverbs modify verbs and answer the questions where, when, and how of the action of the ­verb:
The sick girl remained upstairs. → Where did the sick girl ­remain?
The books arrived today. → When did the books ­arrive?
Bill ran slowly. → How did Bill run?
Often prepositions combine with another word to form a commonly used adverb. Preposi-
tions in this form are frequently used as prefixes. Look at these ­examples:
Adverb	
Meaning
by and ­by	
soon
by and large	
mostly, ­generally
downstairs	
one floor ­below
indoors	
in a ­building
inside	
in the ­interior
outdoors	
in the open air
outside	
in the ­out-of-doors
underwater	
beneath the surface of the ­water
up-country	
toward the interior of the land
uphill	
going up an ­incline
upstairs	
one floor ­above
uptown	
toward the center of the town
Sometimes the combination of a preposition and another word forms a ­noun:
Noun	
Meaning
bylaw	
an organization’s rule
bypass

downfall	
collapse, ruin
infield	
the inner playing area in ­baseball

Prepositions	 289
underarm

underclassman	
a freshman or sophomore in a ­school
underwear	
garments worn under the ­clothes
upheaval	
something rising up suddenly or ­violently
uproar	
violent noise, ­tumult
At other times the combination of a preposition and another word results in a ­verb:
Verb	
Meaning
install	
establish or place in ­position
intone	
recite in a monotone, give ­inflection
outdo	
exceed, ­surpass
outline

live longer than someone else
undergo	
bear up under stress and ­survive
upgrade	
raise to a higher ­level
uphold	
raise, support, ­encourage
upset	
overturn or disquiet ­someone
Adjectives are also formed in this way:
Adjective	
Meaning
bygone	
from a past time
down-and-out	
poor or ­hopeless
downcast	
looking downward or in low ­spirits
downhearted	
discouraged, ­dejected
ingrown

together	
with each other, ­jointly
underage	
not of legal age
undercover	
secret, engaged in ­spying
upstanding	
respectable, ­honest
up-to-date	
modern, ­fashionable
The four preceding lists are only a small sampling of the many words that are derived from 
a preposition combining with another word. When you encounter such words, it is sometimes 
possible to analyze the meaning of the preposition and the meaning of the word with which it has 
been combined in order to determine the meaning of the new word. Consider these ­examples:
(up = rising upward + grade = level) = to upgrade (to raise to a higher ­level)
(down = going downward + fall = stumble) = downfall (collapse, ­ruin)
Keeping this in mind, you can sometimes guess the meaning of new words that are formed 
when a preposition is used as a ­prefix.

Participial ­prepositions
This is a small category of prepositions but one that has some important uses. The present parti-
cipial form of certain verbs, although not true prepositions, sometimes have the characteristic of a 
preposition and are used as one. Present participles are formed by adding -ing to the verb: go → 
going, sing → singing, buy → buying, and so on.
Only certain present participles can act as ­prepositions:
concerning	
following
considering	
regarding
excluding
Their use as a preposition is different from their use as a verb form. Take careful note of the 
­differences:
This is concerning to me. = participle used as an ­adjective
He often wrote me concerning this problem. = preposition (about this ­problem)
The club was considering buying new equipment. = present ­participle
The group spent hours considering this issue. = preposition (on this ­issue)
Why are you excluding our old friends? = present ­participle
We shall meet every Tuesday excluding the first Tuesday in May. = preposition (except the 
first Tuesday in ­May)
An old woman was following us. = present ­participle
The show will go on following one more rehearsal. = preposition (after one more ­rehearsal)
Do you have details regarding this case? = participle used as an ­adjective
She finally spoke up regarding her son’s behavior. = preposition (about her son’s ­behavior)

	 4.	 (following)
	
Prepositions	 293
Postpositive prepositions
This is another very small category of prepositions. They are derived from the shortened form of 
the preposition toward, which is -ward. Postpositive means that the prepositional form -ward 
occurs as a suffix. Notice how often another preposition acts as the prefix (up, down, in, out). 
Look at these ­examples:
backward	
landward
downward	
leeward
forward	
outward
heavenward	
seaward
homeward	
upward
inward	
windward
The points on a compass can also be combined with this suffix: westward, eastward, north-
ward, southward, ­southeastward.
In each case, the word is adjectival or adverbial and means in the direction of. For ­example:
heavenward = in the direction of ­heaven
homeward = in the direction of home
seaward = in the direction of the sea
Two words that may be unfamiliar to you are leeward and windward. They do not conform 
precisely to the general meaning of this category of words. Leeward means the direction in which 
the wind is blowing. Windward means the direction from which the wind is ­coming.
Here are some sample sentences with each of these new ­words:
He walked backward without ­tripping.
When he looked downward, he saw a ­valley.
Tom moved forward a little in the crowded bus.
The balloons slowly rose ­heavenward.
Tomorrow I’m homeward ­bound!
You have to look inward to understand ­yourself.
The little boat drifted ­landward.
We sailed leeward into the ­sunset.
His outward appearance is good, but he’s a nasty man.
Our ship moved seaward out of the little ­harbor.
When I looked upward, I saw the streaks of pink in the sky.
A steamer can travel windward with ­ease.

Words that require a specific preposition
Prepositions have a precise use. They cannot be used randomly but rather serve a par-
ticular function. As already discussed, some show a location. Others indicate a move-
ment or a direction. In fact, there are some words and phrases that require a specific 
preposition in order to achieve the proper meaning. For example, you have to use the 
preposition in with the words interested or interest. Other prepositions make no ­sense:
Correct: I’m very interested in computer ­technology.
Incorrect: Have you always been interested about classical ­music?
Correct: She shows no interest in such ­things.
Incorrect: Tom has a great deal of interest of ­sports.
The same is true with many other words, most of which appear in verb phrases. 
Here is a list of commonly used expressions that require a specific ­preposition:
to ask for	
to long for
to be alarmed by	
to look ­after
to be capable of	
to look at
to be generous with	
to look for
to be interested in/interest in	
to look forward to
to be sure of	
to plead for/plea for
to beg for	
to rely ­(up)on
to belong to	
to speak ­about/of
to care about	
to think ­about/of
to care for	
to wait for
to depend (up)on	
to walk up to
to dream about/of	
to watch over
to forget about	
to wish for
to hope for	
to worry ­about
to listen to	
most passive structures + by
Several phrases use the preposition for to complete their meaning. Whatever 
­follows the preposition becomes the object of the preposition and forms a prepo-
sitional phrase. Look at the examples that ­follow:
Juan asked for a second helping of potatoes. (ask for = ­request)
The dog begged for a ­treat.
Maria is caring for her sick mother. (care for = tend to)
Jim really cares for Barbara. (care for = feel ­affection)
The crowd was hoping for a win, but the team ­lost.
Their family longed for a vacation in ­Europe.
They spent hours looking for the lost ­kitten.

She pleaded with the judge for ­mercy.
The lawyer made a brilliant plea for justice in this ­case.
How long do we have to wait for a bus?
The little boy wished for a new ­bicycle.
There are many phrases that begin with to be. They usually include an adjective or a parti-
ciple, and each one requires the use of a specific ­preposition:
The woman was suddenly alarmed by the threat of a ­storm.
I ­didn’t think you were capable of such a terrible ­thing.
Mr. Garcia is always so generous with his ­time.
She’s not interested in old ­movies.
I’m developing an interest in ­science.
How can you be sure of what to do ­next?
Phrases that require to:
That red car belongs to me. (belongs to = ­ownership)
Tom wants to belong to our sports club. (belong to = ­membership)
I listened to the speaker’s remarks with great ­interest.
Everyone is looking forward to the start of ­vacation.
A beautiful woman walked up to me and shook my ­hand.
Phrases that require ­about:
My brother cares a lot about his ­girlfriend.
Last night I dreamt about our trip to ­Alaska.
She says she’ll never forget about me.
You ­shouldn’t speak about such ­things!
It seems I’m always thinking about ­food.
My parents still worry about my sister and me.
Phrases that require on or ­upon:
You can always depend (up)on us.
There’s no one here that I can rely ­(up)on.
Phrases that require of. Notice that these phrases are often the same ones that use ­about:
The dog seemed to be dreaming of chasing a ­rabbit.
Someone was speaking of the new boss’s bad ­temper.
Guess what I’m thinking of.
The verb to look forms two new expressions with the prepositions after (meaning “to care 
for”) and at:
The men stayed home to look after the ­children.
They were looking upward at the stars in the sky.
When the verb watch is combined with the preposition over, it means “to tend to” and “to 
­protect”:
The shepherd watched over the nervous flock of ­sheep.
When an active sentence is changed to a passive sentence, the subject of the active sentence 
becomes the object of the preposition by in the passive ­sentence:
Active: A thief stole the ­wallet.
Passive: The wallet was stolen by the ­thief.

Prepositions and phrasal ­verbs
This is a very large category of verbal expressions that use prepositions to change the meaning of 
a verb. It is different from the ordinary combination of a verb and a preposition because the verb-
plus-preposition phrase as a whole acquires a completely new meaning and one that is often radi-
cally different from the original meaning of the ­verb.
Here are a few sentences with the verb to come used with its regular meaning. Each one has 
a prepositional phrase in it, but the meaning of to come is not ­changed:
These young people come from ­Spain.
He came into the room and sat ­down.
Come with me, ­please.
Now look at these sentences with to come and a preposition. The meaning of the verb to come 
is ­changed:
The man came to after a few minutes. (He regained ­consciousness.)
Tom finally came around and signed the contract. (He changed his ­mind.)
How did you come up with this idea? (How did you create this ­idea?)
Verbs that change their meaning when combined with one or more prepositions are called 
phrasal verbs. They are numerous in English and are an important element of grammar. It is 
essential to identify them and to be able to understand the new meanings that are derived by their 
formation. Let’s look at some important phrasal ­verbs.
Ask
The regular verb to ask means “to pose a question” or “to make a request.” That meaning is altered 
when the verb is combined with certain prepositions. In phrasal verbs those prepositions are 
sometimes called particles. You will notice that the particle-prepositions are often used as ­adverbs.
The phrasal verb to ask around means “to seek information from a variety of sources.” The par-
ticle about is sometimes used in place of ­around:
I asked around about the new girl and learned she was from ­Poland.
Ask around and you’ll learn where you can rent a cheap ­apartment.
Ask about and you’ll discover where there’s a nice place to eat.

The phrasal verb to ask out has changed its meaning again. It now means “to invite someone 
to go somewhere” or “to invite on a date.” It suggests that someone is romantically interested in 
another ­person:
John asked Maria out, but she ­refused.
I was too shy to ask her out.
The handsome man was asked out by his friend’s ­cousin.
Be
You are already familiar with the verb to be. It shows the existence of someone or something 
(They are here.) or helps to describe a condition or quality (I am old.). It is an irregular verb and 
is the only English verb that has a complex conjugation in the present and past ­tenses:
Present	
Past
I am	
we are

Its participle is been: I have been, you have been, he has been, and so on.
The verb to be is also used as an auxiliary with a present participle to show a continuing ­action:
I am ­singing.
You were ­writing.
They have been ­studying.
Tom will be ­working.
But the meaning of the verb is altered when it is used in certain phrases. Let’s look at some 
examples of phrasal verbs formed from this ­verb.
The verb to be in has a very specific meaning. It says that someone is at home or available at 
the ­office:
I’m in for the ­night.
Is Dr. Jones in this ­afternoon?
Tell my client that I won’t be in until eight in the ­morning.
The opposite of to be in is to be out. It says that someone is not at home or not available at the 
­office:
John is out and won’t be home until ­late.
I believe Dr. Jones is out for the day. He’ll be in the office at 8:00 a.m. ­tomorrow.
In the phrasal verb to be on, only the preposition on has been added, but the meaning is 
completely changed by it. This verb means that some apparatus, machinery, or equipment is 
functioning. It is the opposite of to be off:
Press the green button, and the machine is on. Press the red button, and the machine is off.
It’s hot in here. Is the air conditioning on?
The engine is so quiet that I can’t tell if it is on.
Use to be out of sight to say that you can no longer see someone or something or that some-
one or something is no longer in your range of ­vision:
He ran up the hill and was soon out of ­sight.
In a couple more minutes the ship will be out of ­sight.

Your hairdo is old fashioned. Why can’t you be more with it?
John drank a lot last night and isn’t with it ­today.

Look at the map I found. We’re finally onto something that will help to find the ­treasure.

on, to take over, to take up, and to talk over can act as the participle in a 
passive voice ­sentence:
The books are being taken back by Tim.

Remember these separable phrasal ­verbs
Sometimes particles have two possible positions in a sentence with a phrasal verb when the direct 
object in the sentence is a noun: after the object or before the object. But when the object is a 
­pronoun, it has only one position: after the ­object.
You encountered these separable phrasal verbs: to kick off, to kick out, to knock down, to 
knock off, to knock out, to put down, to put on, to put up, to quiet down, to take back, to take down, 
to take in, to take off, to take on, to take over, to take up, and to talk over. In these verbs the

You have had only a small sampling of phrasal verbs and the prepositions that help to form 
them. It is important to recognize phrasal verbs in order to determine their actual meaning. Fre-
quently, someone who is learning English assumes the meaning of a sentence knowing the mean-
ing of the basic verb in that sentence. But the verb could be a phrasal verb and, therefore, the 
meaning might escape the ­learner.
When you identify a phrasal verb in a sentence, look it up in a good dictionary. In the sub-
meanings of the basic verb are often frequently used phrasal verbs. Here is a sample dictionary 
entry:
come verb (came, come, coming) 1. to move to a place; to move here; to approach. 2. to 
arrive; to be present. –to come about 1. to happen or take place. 2. to turn to the opposite 
tack, as of a ship. –to come to 1. to revive; to regain consciousness. 2. to amount to
You will notice that to come about and to come to are both phrasal verbs, and the meaning of 
the phrases differ considerably from the meaning of the basic verb come. It is unwise to guess at 
the meaning of phrasal verbs. Rely on a good ­dictionary.
A variety of prepositional uses
You have encountered a wide variety of prepositions and learned how they are used. The fol-
lowing exercises will give you practice in identifying these varieties and in using them in 
­context.

You are already aware that nouns fall into two general categories: proper nouns 
and common nouns. All nouns refer to persons, places, things, or ideas, but only 
certain nouns—proper nouns—are capitalized. All other nouns do not require 
capitalization (unless they occur at the beginning of a sentence). Let’s look at the 
specifics that govern English capitalization.
A. The first word in a sentence is always capitalized. It does not matter if the 
­sentence begins with a common noun or some other grammatical element.
Terrell is my brother.
The children are fast asleep.
Are you going home now?
When is that program on?
B. The first word in the title of any work of art (e.g., short story, article, book, TV 
program, film, painting, song, CD) is always capitalized. All the other words in 
the title are also capitalized, except for the articles, conjunctions, and ­prepositions. 
(However, if an article, conjunction, or preposition is the last word in a title, it 
must be capitalized.)
“How to Buy a House”
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
Finding Nemo
“Take Me Out to the Ball Game”
C. The same rule applies to official names of businesses and institutions.
The University of Illinois at Chicago
Sears Roebuck and Company
D. First names, last names, initials, and personal titles of all kinds are always 
capitalized.
Jason Kensington
Ms. Alicia Jones
Professor Rosa Morena
Senator William Hayes
General Dwight D. Eisenhower
J. D. Powers

E. Titles that are not part of directly addressing the person who bears the title should not be 
­capitalized. Compare the following:
I met a senator at the meeting.	
Hello, Senator. How are you?
Is she the governor now?	
It’s good to see you, Governor Bejcek.
A captain entered the room.	
Please sit down, Captain Bligh.
F. All days of the week, months of the year, and holidays are capitalized. Seasons and other 
­categories of time are not.
Is it Monday already?	
The weather is cooler in the fall.
My favorite month is June.	
Where do you spend the winter?
She was born March 3, 2001.	
How many years are in a decade?
Today is the Fourth of July.	
The twentieth century was important.
I like Halloween.	
It’s a new millennium.
G. There are special rules for abbreviations for time. B.C. and A.D. are always capitalized. B.C. is used 
for eras or years that occurred before Christ. A.D. is used for eras or years that occurred anno Domini 
(“in the year of our Lord”), that is, beginning with the first year after Christ’s birth. (B.C. follows the 
date; A.D. precedes the date.) a.m. and p.m. may or may not be capitalized. a.m. refers to the hours 
between midnight and noon, and p.m. refers to the hours between noon and midnight.
That happened in the fifth century B.C.
Columbus first landed in the New World in A.D. 1492.
They arrived exactly at 9:00 p.m.

The subjunctive is used in some limited but important ways. It is used to express 
a demand, suggestion, or request (I suggest you be on time.); to express a wish (If 
only Jim were here.); or to set a condition for a future action (We would leave if the 
storm would let up.). To understand these uses, you need to examine the subjunc-
tive conjugations.
The present tense subjunctive is formed from the infinitive of a verb minus the 
particle word to. Notice that each pronoun requires the identical verb form:
Pronoun	
to be	
to go	
to have	
to work
I
be	
go	
have	
work
you	
be	
go	
have	
work
he, she, it	
be	
go	
have	
work
we	
be	
go	
have	
work
they	
be	
go	
have	
work
The past tense subjunctive is formed from the plural past tense of either a regu-
lar or an irregular verb. Notice again that each pronoun requires the identical verb 
form:
Pronoun	
to be	
to go	
to have	
to work
I
were	
went	
had	
worked
you	
were	
went	
had	
worked
he, she, it	
were	
went	
had	
worked
we	
were	
went	
had	
worked
they	
were	
went	
had	
worked
A third subjunctive conjugation is formed with the word would together with 
an infinitive, or would have plus a past participle. Look at these examples:
Indicative Sentences	
Subjunctive Sentences
He is here.
He would be here.
She buys a book.
She would buy a book.
We have spoken.	
We would have spoken.
I have played.	
I would have played.
The present tense subjunctive is used to express a demand, suggestion, or 
request. In these instances, the subjunctive must be used in place of a regular 
Subjunctive mood
	
Subjunctive mood	 327
present tense conjugation. Notice that it is optional to use the conjunction that. Consider these 
sentences:
She demanded you be on time tomorrow. (not are)
She demanded that you be on time tomorrow.
I suggested he come by for a visit. (not comes)
I suggested that he come by for a visit.
The judge requested the lawyer have the documents prepared. (not has)
The judge requested that the lawyer have the documents prepared.
This same structure is used with a few other similar verbs: to command, to order, to propose.
The past tense subjunctive is often used to express a wish:
I wish Ahmed were my brother.
She wished she had enough money for a car.
If only my mother worked for him, too.
The children wish it already were Christmas.
Note that a wish can be expressed by beginning a sentence with if or if only.
You should be aware that were is sometimes avoided in casual conversation and is frequently 
replaced by the simple past tense verb was with singular subjects (e.g., I wish Ahmed was my 
brother.).
The subjunctive formed with would is used when there are two clauses in a sentence and one 
of them is an if-clause. This kind of sentence sets a condition in one clause for the action to occur 
in the second clause. The past tense subjunctive is used in the if-clause. The word would appears 
in the clause that does not begin with if. Some examples:
If Nadia were here, Mother would be very happy.
If I had a million dollars, I would buy a big house.
She would travel to Spain if her uncle invited her.
Mr. Perez would learn English if he lived in Texas.
These sentences mean that the action would happen in the present or the future if the conditions 
were right.
This would happen if these conditions were right.
She would travel to Spain if her uncle invited her.
The same format is required even if the verbs are structured like the present perfect tense (I have 
gone, you have seen, etc.):
If Nadia had been here, Mother would have been very happy.
Mr. Perez would have learned English if he had lived in Texas.
These sentences mean that the action would have happened in the past if the conditions had been 
right.
This would have happened if these conditions had been right.
Mr. Perez would have learned English if he had lived in Texas.

Hypothetical ­conditional
The sentences you will study in this unit have two parts: an if clause and a main clause. The if 
clause consists of a condition that is either slightly possible or impossible; the main clause states 
the consequences of the condition mentioned in the if ­clause.
Slightly possible: If he felt better, he would come with us.
Impossible: If my aunt were still alive, she would be a hundred years old ­today.
To form a hypothetical conditional that refers to present or future time, use the simple past 
tense in the if clause; use a modal verb (either would, might, or could) and the base form of the 
main verb in the main ­clause.
If he studied more, he would earn better ­grades.
In formal English, were is used in the if clause, even following the first- and third-person sin-
gular ­pronouns.
If I were you, I would look for a job.
If she were here, we could ­leave.
To form a hypothetical conditional that refers to past time, use the past perfect in the if clause; 
use would have, might have, or could have and the perfect/passive form of the main verb in the 
main ­clause.
If they had asked earlier, I could have helped ­them.

The subjunctive mood
To review, the English subjunctive mood has three forms. One is the infinitive of a verb with the 
omission of the particle word to: (to) go, (to) be, and so on. The second form is the past tense of a 
verb. In the case of the verb to be, only the plural past tense (were) is used in the subjunctive. The 
third form uses the auxiliary would followed by an infinitive or by have and a past participle. 
Let’s look at these three forms:
Infinitive	
Form 1	
Form 2	
Form 3
to be	
be	
were	
would be/would have been
to come	
come	
came	
would come/would have come
to go	
go	
went	
would go/would have gone
to speak	
speak	
spoke	
would speak/would have spoken
	
Subjunctive mood	 333
The infinitive form of the subjunctive is used in sentences that convey a suggestion, a request, a recom-
mendation, or a proposal. Note that the conjunction that is optional in such sentences. For example:
I suggest she find another way to get to work.	
not she finds
Would you recommend that they be allowed to stay here?	
not they are
The past-tense form of the subjunctive is used to express a wish or a condition and is often 
combined with a subjunctive clause that includes either would plus an infinitive or would have 
plus a past participle:
	 A wish
If only Jack were here with us now.
If you could just try to understand my perspective.
If only he had tried a little harder.
	 A condition
If the rain let up, we would go out for a long walk.
My son would have been here if he had known that you needed help.
If you were my son, I would give you the same advice.
Notice that a “wish” statement often includes the word only.
In a conditional statement, the if clause sets the condition, and the accompanying clause is 
the “result” if the condition is met.

The comparative of an adjective or adverb describes a comparison of one person 
or thing with another person or thing. Most comparatives require an -er ending, 
for example, taller, shallower. If the adjective or adverb ends in a single consonant, 
that consonant is doubled before adding the ending: mad ➞ madder. If an ­adjective 
or adverb ends in -y, change it to -i then add -er: funny ➞ funnier.
The superlative of an adjective or adverb shows the greatest degree of the 
meaning of the adjective or adverb. Most superlatives end in -est: tallest, shallow-
est. If the adjective or adverb ends in a single consonant, that consonant is doubled 
before adding the ending: mad ➞ maddest. If an adjective or adverb ends in -y, 
change it to -i then add -est: funny ➞ funniest.
Both the comparative and the superlative are formed in another way by using 
more or most. The word more is placed in front of the adjective or adverb to form 
the comparative, and the word most is placed in front of the adjective or adverb to 
form the superlative: more interesting/most interesting, more logical/most logical. 
This formation is used primarily with words that are of two syllables or more and 
that come to English from French, Latin, or other foreign sources.
The other formation (long, longer, longest) is Anglo-Saxon in origin. 
Compare these lists of comparatives and superlatives:
Anglo-Saxon Origin	
Foreign Origin
bigger	
biggest	
more critical	
most critical
finer	
finest	
more dangerous	
most dangerous
grander	
grandest	
more dynamic

more intense	
most intense
poorer	
poorest	
more sensitive	
most sensitive
smaller	
smallest	
more visible	
most visible
thinner	
thinnest

Note that words that end in -ful, -less, and -ing use more and most to form the 
comparative and superlative, even though such words do not have a foreign lan-
guage origin.

It is possible to use a comparative in a sentence without mentioning the person or thing with 
which another person or thing is being compared. Look at these examples:
Jorge is a lot taller.
My sister was thinner a few years ago.
In such sentences the person or thing compared is assumed. When stating the person or thing 
with which another person or thing is being compared, use the word than:
Jorge is a lot taller than Michelle.
My sister was thinner a few years ago than she is now.
The formation of both adjectives and adverbs in the comparative is identical. The difference is 
how they are used in a sentence:
My car is faster than your car. (adjective)
She runs faster than you do. (adverb)
With adverbs that end in -ly, both forms of comparative and superlative are possible:
He spoke quicker./He spoke more quickly.
He spoke the quickest./He spoke the most quickly.
The superlative adjective or adverb frequently is preceded by the word the:
Lars is the strongest boy.
She is the most beautiful girl here.
When the superlative is a predicative adjective and not followed by a noun, the word the can be 
omitted:
Lars is strongest when he’s not tired.
She is most beautiful when she wakes up in the morning.
Comparative and superlative adverbs that are formed with more and most require the adverbial 
ending -ly:
more willingly
most capably

Conjunctions join words, phrases, and sentences together. First, let’s look at some 
of the commonly used coordinating conjunctions: and, but, or, nor, for, so, and yet. 
Notice how they can combine words, phrases, or complete sentences:

unable to work	
fire, but Lance went

potatoes
Correlative conjunctions are also important. They consist of a pair of words that 
appear in different parts of the same sentence. The most commonly used are both 
. . . and, either . . . or, neither . . . nor, and not only . . . but also (sometimes stated as 
not only . . . also). ­Examples:
Both Yoko and Marco have problems.
Either you work hard or you leave.
Neither the boys nor the girls wanted to end the game.
You are not only a poor loser but also a bad soccer player.
Dependent (or subordinating) clauses consist of a subject and a verb. But these 
clauses usually cannot stand alone. Dependent clauses are preceded by subordi-
nating conjunctions and are combined with an independent clause. The list of sub-
ordinating conjunctions is long. Here are some of the most commonly used:
after	
before	
since	
until
although

Using conjunctions
Conjunctions connect words, phrases, and clauses. But not all conjunctions function in the same 
way. This unit describes the types of English conjunctions and how they are used in sentences.
Coordinating conjunctions
Coordinating conjunctions connect words or groups of words of the same grammatical type, 
such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives, or of the same grammatical structure, such as phrases and 
clauses. These are the coordinating conjunctions: and, but, or, yet, for, so, and nor.
If a coordinating conjunction connects more than two elements, it is generally placed 
between the last two elements of the series. The other elements are separated by commas.
In order to find the treasure, you will need a compass, a shovel, a map,  
and a lamp.
He wanted to buy a hat, a pair of gloves, or some new boots.
Coordinating conjunctions can also connect other elements, such as infinitives and infini-
tive phrases.
She wants to watch a movie or (to) listen to music.
It’s difficult to listen to him and to know that he is lying.
If a coordinating conjunction connects independent clauses, the conjunction is usually 
­preceded by a comma. An independent clause is one that can stand by itself and make complete 
sense. If a coordinating conjunction connects independent clauses, it creates a compound 
sentence.
She spoke to him harshly, but there was real pity for him in her heart.
Tom was exhausted, yet he found enough strength to lead them out of the woods.
If the subject, verb, or auxiliary is the same in both clauses, the one in the second clause can 
be omitted. When this occurs, the comma can be omitted.
He spoke slowly but [he] pronounced each word in anger.
The men worked on the house and [worked] on the shed in the backyard.
Someone is knocking at the door and [is] calling your name.

Conjunctions and their meaning
But and yet indicate a contrast between the elements they connect.
His knee was hurting, but he finished the race anyway.
The grape juice was bitter yet hydrating.
Or indicates a choice or offers alternatives between the elements it connects.
On Sunday, we will go to the lake or to the river.
He wants a new bicycle or some roller skates for Christmas.
Nor typically connects negative statements. Note that if an independent clause follows nor, 
its subject and verb are inverted.
They did not fix my camera, nor did they fix my lens.
She did not tell us where she was traveling to, nor did she tell us how long she would be gone.
The conjunction for is generally synonymous with because. So has a meaning similar to 
therefore. For and so can also express a cause-and-effect relationship.
She could not think clearly, for her heart was so full of anger.
They could not find the car keys, so they broke the window to get in.

Correlative conjunctions
Correlative conjunctions follow the same set of rules coordinating conjunctions do. Both types 
of conjunctions function in the same way, except that correlative conjunctions are composed of 
two parts. The most common of these conjunctions are both . . . and . . . , not only . . . but also . . . , 
either . . . or . . . , and neither . . . nor . . . .
When two subjects are connected by not only . . . but also . . . , either . . . or . . . , or nei-
ther . . . nor . . . , the subject that is closer to the verb determines whether the verb is singular or 
plural. However, when two subjects are connected with both . . . and . . . , the verb is always 
plural.
Not only my sister but also my cousin is here.
Not only my sister but also my parents are here.
Either the cops or the robber was blamed for the victim’s death.
Either my sister or my parents were in attendance.
Neither my sister nor my cousin is here.
Neither my sister nor my parents are here.
Both my sister and my cousin are here.
Both the winter and the spring have been cold and damp.
These examples illustrate correlative conjunctions used with the subjects of the sentences. They 
can also be used to join objects in a sentence.
He teased both my sister and my cousin.
She bought not only a new blouse but also a new skirt.
I spoke to either your wife or your daughter.
We saw neither the crime nor the criminal.

Complete sentences are separated by a period, not a comma.

However, you can use a comma before a coordinating conjunction to combine two sentences 
into a single sentence. If the subjects of the two sentences are identical, the subject of the second 
sentence can be omitted. In such a case, the comma is not used.
It was very cold, and he put on a sweater.
We borrowed money and bought a used car.
If the sentences are very short, the comma can be omitted.

Subordinating conjunctions
Subordinating conjunctions connect dependent, or subordinate, clauses to independent clauses. 
An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. A dependent clause requires an 
independent clause to be correct or even to make sense. Furthermore, a dependent clause ­always 
begins with a subordinate conjunction.

Following is a list of the most common subordinating conjunctions.

if	
unless
although	
before	
now that	
until
as

than

while
They will head home after they finish eating.
She enjoyed talking to him, because he was so smart.
Tom will not join the team unless he can be the captain.
Several subordinating conjunctions express time relationships: after, before, until, when, and 
while. These conjunctions indicate when the action of the dependent clause takes place in relation 
to the action of the independent clause.
He was a doctor before becoming a veterinarian.
Pedro waited in line while Vanessa looked for a place to sit.
The subordinating conjunction because introduces a clause that provides a reason for some-
thing. It answers the question “why.”
She loves the Doors, because they sing catchy songs.
The subordinating conjunctions (ever) since and now that express one of two things: an 
­explanation or a time relationship.
They cannot go to Mexico, since they do not have enough money.
We have been eager to watch the movie ever since we saw the preview.
Now that they have enough money, they are going to Mexico.
Although, even though, and though express exception or indicate that a condition exists 
despite some other condition.
She liked her old apartment, although it was small and smelly.
I was good at volleyball, even though I was short.
I hated his choice of music, though his voice was quite good.
When it follows a negative statement, the conjunction unless expresses requirements or 
conditions.
She can’t be part of the band unless she sings well.
The dependent if clause expresses a condition that must be met, and the independent clause 
describes what will happen when that condition is met.
He can be part of the band if he plays guitar or drums.
No punctuation is required before many subordinating conjunctions, especially those 
that express a time relationship, if the conjunction follows the independent clause.
	
Before he became a professional surfer, he was a skater.
	
He was a skater before he became a professional surfer.
The relative pronouns who, whom, that, which, and whose can also function like subordinat-
ing conjunctions, because they introduce dependent clauses.
	
Conjunctions	 353
The conjunction than may be used as a subordinating conjunction, often introducing an ­elliptical 
clause, that is, a clause in which information that is understood is omitted.
You speak English far better than I [do].
I like apple pie better than [I like] chocolate cake.
Colloquially, it is quite common to use than as a preposition.
Cathy is more talented than him.
My brother plays the piano better than me.
To be more precise, the verb in the dependent clause may be included, which requires than 
to be treated as a conjunction.
Cathy is more talented than he is.
My brother plays the piano better than I do.

Interrogatives
Interrogatives are words that ask a question. They are placed at (or near) the begin-
ning of the sentence, and that sentence ends with a question mark. Some inter-
rogatives are pronouns: who, whom, whose, what, and which. They can act as:
	 the subject of a sentence
	 a direct object
	 the object of a preposition
	 a possessive 
Look at these examples:
Subject:	
Who is standing on the corner?
	
Whose is for sale? (The noun subject is understood.)
	
What needs to be done?
	
Which is for me?
Direct object:	
Whom did you see last night?
	
Whose did you borrow? (The noun object is understood.)
	
What will they do?
	
Which have you selected?
Preposition:	
With whom was she dancing?
	
About whose was he speaking? (The noun is understood.)
	
To what are you referring?
	
In which is it located?
Possessive:	
Whose house burned down? (Whose modifies house.)
Other interrogatives act as adverbs: how, when, where, and why. Some examples:
Question	
Possible Answer
How did he walk?	
slowly
When was the party?	
on Tuesday
Where are you going?	
to the store
Why are you limping?	
because my foot hurts
There are also some commonly used phrases that are a combination of what, 
which, and how and other words. Questions are formed with them like with other 
interrogatives:
what brand of, what kind of, what sort of, what about
which one, which way, which part of, which of you
how much, how many, how often, how about
	
Interrogatives	 359
Of course, these are not the only such combinations. They are examples. You will discover 
others that are formed similarly. Some example sentences:
What kind of dress do you want to buy?
What about your brother?
Which one is for me?
Which of you will help me?
Interrogative words can be used as conjunctions to combine two clauses. You encountered some of 
them in Unit 21 on conjunctions. But be careful! The sentence formed by using an interrogative as a 
conjunction is not necessarily a question when combined with another clause. It depends upon 
whether you are asking a question or making a statement:
Question	
Statement
Do you know who he is?	
Jill told me who he is.
Does she understand how it works?	
I can’t explain how it works.
Who told you where it was?	
They ­couldn’t discover where it was.
Can you tell me what kind of car this is?	
I don’t know what kind of car this is.
Notice the change in word order between a direct question and an interrogative clause combined 
with another clause. In direct questions the verb precedes the subject. In an interrogative clause the 
verb follows the subject.
Who are these people?	
She asked me who these people are.
When did they arrive?	
I don’t know when they arrived.
How far can he swim?	
They ask how far he can swim.

Using interrogative sentences
There are two types of interrogative sentences, and both types ask questions. The first type can be 
called a yes-no question, because the answer to such a question will begin with the affirmative 
word yes or the negative word no. Most questions of this type begin with a form of the auxiliary 
verb do.
auxiliary + subject + verb + predicate +?
Do + you + have + the books +?
Yes-no questions
If the verb in a yes-no question is the verb to be or the verb to have, the question is formed simply 
by placing the verb before the subject of the sentence.
to be/to have + subject + predicate +?
Is + she + the new student +?
This occurs in any tense. In the case of the perfect tenses or the future tense, it is the auxiliary of the 
verbs to be and to have that precede the subject. For example:
Present	
Is she aware of the problem?
Past	
Was there enough time to finish  
	
	
the exam?
Present perfect	
Have you been here before?
Future	
Will Professor Burns be today’s  
	
	
lecturer again?
	
362	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
Present	
Have you enough money for the  
	
	
tickets?
Past	
Had he adequate notice?
Present perfect	
Has your mother had the operation  
	
	
yet?
Future	
Will the workers have some time off?
Auxiliaries
This kind of question structure, in which the verb precedes the subject, also occurs with numer-
ous auxiliaries, such as the following:
be able to	
ought to
can	 	
shall/will
could	
should
have		
would
must
auxiliary + subject + verb form + predicate +? 
Should + we + help + them +?
Let’s look at some example sentences:
Are you able to make out her signature?
Have you worked here for very long?
Ought she to have said that to her mother?
Notice in each example that the sentence contains a second verb. The initial verb is an aux-
iliary, and it is followed by an infinitive (such as to work) or by an elliptical infinitive, which omits 
the particle word (to); for example: are you able to make, will you try. With most auxiliaries, it is 
the tense of the auxiliary that determines the “time” of the action; for example: present (can he 
speak) and past (could he speak).
With the auxiliary have, however, its tense conjugation combined with a past participle (and 
not an infinitive) identifies the tense as either present perfect, past perfect, or future perfect:
Present perfect	
has he spoken
Past perfect	
had he spoken
Future perfect	
will he have spoken
The auxiliaries shall and will identify the future tense and are followed by elliptical infinitives:
Shall I get you something for dinner? 
Will you be staying the night?
In declarative sentences, most English speakers use will, although technically, shall should be 
used with singular and plural pronouns in the first person, and will should be used with the sec-
ond and third persons. In questions, the rule is applied more strictly: shall with first-person sin-
gular and plural, and will with second- and third-person singular and plural.
	
	
Singular	
Plural
First	
Shall I turn on the TV?	
Shall we go to the movies tonight?
Second	
Tom, will you help me with this?	
Boys, will you please stop your arguing?
Third	
Will she like this dress?	
Will they be able to spend some time  
	
	
	
with us?
	
Interrogatives	 363
It is important to be knowledgeable about the other auxiliaries and how they function in the vari-
ous tenses. Let’s focus on two that can be conjugated like other verbs and form questions by plac-
ing the conjugated verb or its auxiliaries before the subject:
Present	
Is she able to stand alone?
Past	
Was she able to stand alone?
Present perfect	
Has she been able to stand alone?
Future	
Will she be able to stand alone?

Questions with do/did
Verbs that are not auxiliaries form questions by beginning them in the present tense with do and 
in the past tense with did. The use of do/did does not occur in the other tenses. Let’s examine a 
few cases in point:
Present	 	
Do you enjoy her classes?
Past	 	
Did you enjoy her classes?
Present perfect	
Have you enjoyed her classes?
Future	
Will you enjoy her classes?
Present

Past	 	
Did Thomas visit you often?
Present perfect	
Has Thomas visited you often?
Future

Since have is an auxiliary, it can be used in questions without do/did. Nevertheless, there is a ten-
dency to add the extra do/did auxiliary both in speech and in writing.
Present	
Do you have a few extra dollars?
Past	
Did you have a few extra dollars?
Present perfect	
Have you had a few extra dollars?
Future	
Will you have a few extra dollars?
When using have to (which is much the same as must in meaning), you must use do/did in the 
present and past tenses.
Present	
Do they have to work so many hours?
Past	
Did they have to work so many hours?
Present perfect	
Have they had to work so many hours?
Future	
Will they have to work so many hours?
The auxiliaries to want to and to like to form their present- and past-tense questions with do/did. For 
example:
Present	 	
Does Mom want to go shopping?
Past	 	
Did Mom want to go shopping?
Present perfect	
Has Mom wanted to go shopping?
Future	
Will Mom want to go shopping?
Present	 	
Do they like to listen to rap music?
Past	 	
Did they like to listen to rap music?
Present perfect	
Have they liked to listen to rap music?
Future	
Will they like to listen to rap music?
You should be aware that while both to want to and to like to are auxiliary verbs, they are also used 
as transitive verbs, taking a direct object. When they are used as transitive verbs, the final to is omit-
ted from the verb: to want and to like. Even when used as transitive verbs, they form their present- 
and past-tense questions with do/did.
do/did + subject + want/like + predicate +?
Does + she + like + him +?
Present	
Do you want some help?
	
	
Does she like pizza?
Past	
Did you want some help?
	
	
Did she like pizza?

Progressive-form questions
Just as in a declarative sentence, verbs in a question can be formed in the progressive, which 
means that they are actions in progress or incomplete. Since the progressive form is composed of 
a conjugation of to be plus a present participle (is going, was singing), and to be never forms a ques-
tion with do/did, all questions that have a progressive verb will begin with the verb to be or its 
auxiliaries.
to be + subject + present participle (-ing) +?
Are + you + working in the garden +?
For example:
Present	
Are you planning on attending the party?
Past	
Was she sleeping when the storm hit?
Present perfect	
Have the men been working in the mine  
	
  again?
Future 	
Will he be preparing for final exams?
Be aware that a verb in a do/did question will not require the auxiliary do/did when it is 
changed to its progressive form. For example:
Do you attend a state university?
Are you attending a state university?
Did the campers sleep in tents?
Were the campers sleeping in tents?

a.  

Questions using interrogative words
The second kind of question formation is one that begins with an interrogative word: who, what, 
why, how, which, or when. The rules that appy about the use of do/did in questions apply in the 
same way with questions that begin with an interrogative word. For example:
Can he understand you?	
How can he understand you?
Do you like that man?	
Why do you like that man?
Are you coming to the party?	
When are you coming to the party?
Have you found the books?	
Where have you found the books?
As you can see from these examples, yes-no questions and questions that begin with an 
interrogative word can be, for the most part, identical. Likewise, the choice of do/did in a question 
is the same in either type of question. This is possible because the interrogatives illustrated in the 
	
Interrogatives	 369
four examples are substitutes for adverbs, and since adverbs only modify, changes are not always 
needed in a question.
This is not the case, however, with who and what. These two interrogatives are actually pro-
nouns that stand in place of a subject or an object in a sentence. In the following examples, an 
arrow (→) points out how a declarative sentence is changed to an interrogative sentence with who 
or what. For example: 
Subject	
The man is sick.  →  Who is sick?
Subject	
A box is needed.  →  What is needed?
Object	
They met the woman.  →  Whom did they meet?
Object	
She broke the lamp.  →  What did she break?
Object	
I spoke with him.  →  With whom did I speak?
Object	
The boy sat on it.  →  On what did the boy sit?
In less formal style, who is often substituted for whom. This occurs even in writing, although in 
formal writing the appropriate use of whom should be applied.
Also, the placing of a preposition in front of whom or what is formal in style. In a less formal 
version, prepositions are placed at the end of the question and would look like this:
Who did you speak with?
What did the boy sit on?
If a possessive of who or what is required, use whose or of what.
I spoke with Tom’s father.	
With whose father did you speak?
The color of the book is red.	
Whose color is red? (The color of what is red?)

The interrogative how is often combined with other words to form new interrogatives. Just some 
of these are how much, how many, how often, how old, how long, and how tall. In sentences, they

Negation
No is the opposite of yes. It is used as a negative response to a question. But there 
are other negative forms in English as well.
Simple negation occurs by placing not after the conjugated verb in a sentence. 
It is important to remember that it is the conjugated verb that determines the 
location of not and not the other verbal forms that may also be in a sentence.
He is not at home today.
We do not want to buy a car at this time.
Marianne has not responded to my letter.
If the sentence is in the form of a question, not stands behind the subject:
Can you not understand?
How could he not have helped us?
Will Martin not share his good fortune?
But in the case of a contraction with not, the two parts of the contraction are never 
separated. This is true whether the sentence is a statement or a question:
He isn’t at home today.	
Can’t you understand?
We don’t want to buy a car.	
Why ­couldn’t he help us?
She hasn’t answered yet.	
Won’t Martin share with us?
If the negated verb is not to be, to have, or other auxiliary (can, should, must, etc.), 
the negation is formed from the present or past tense of do, depending upon the 
tense of the verb:
I am not	
I do not speak
she has not	
she ­doesn’t learn
you ­shouldn’t	
you did not understand
he can’t	
he ­didn’t worry
Certain other negative words have two forms. One form begins with no- (except 
for never and neither), and the other consists of not followed by another word. 
When these words are not negative, they have a special positive form that often 
uses the word some. Look at the varieties that exist:
Formed with no-	
Formed with not	
Positive Form
none	
not any	
some
no one	
not anyone (or anybody)	
someone (or somebody)
	
Negation	 373
Formed with no-	
Formed with not	
Positive Form
nothing	
not anything	
something
nowhere	
not anywhere	
somewhere
never*	
not ever	
ever
neither*	
not either	
either
*Take note of the spelling.
Be aware of how the two forms are used differently:
I have none to give you.	
I do not have anything to give you.
He spoke to no one.	
He did not speak to anyone.
We want nothing from you.	
We do not want anything from you.
She’s nowhere to be found.	
She’s not anywhere to be found.
I’ll never forgive you.	
I will not ever forgive you.
He wants neither of them.	
He does not want either of them.
When the negative word is removed from the sentence, the positive form replaces it:
Hector ­didn’t dance with anyone. ➞ Hector danced with someone.
The customer wants nothing. ➞ The customer wants something.
Note: English never uses a double negative—for example, ­doesn’t want nothing.

When numbers are used in equations, there are specific mathematical terms to be used. In addition, 
numbers are combined by either the word plus or the word and: five plus three, ten and nine.
In subtraction, the equation requires using the word minus (−): ten minus four.
In multiplication, the equation requires using the word times (×): six times three.
In division, the equation requires the phrase divided by (÷ or /): twenty divided by five.
If an equation has an equal sign (=) in it, it is stated as equals or is: two plus two equals four, 
six minus three is three.
If a number is a decimal, the decimal is expressed by the word point: 6.5 is said as “six point 
five”; 10.7 is said as “ten point seven.”
The ordinal numbers are those that show a rank in a group or series. Most ordinals are 
formed by adding -th to the end of the number: tenth, twentieth, sixty-seventh, hundredth, and so 
on. But five ordinal numbers have special spellings which should be memorized:
1 = first
2 = second
3 = third
5 = fifth
12 = twelfth
Some example sentences with ordinal numbers:
We have three daughters, but Denise was our first.
The second seating for dinner is at 8:30 P.M.
She was born on the twenty-fifth of June.
Dates are expressed in two ways: May fifth or the fifth of May. When giving a date as a number, it 
is most common to give the month before the day: 9/11 = September eleventh, 6/12 = June twelfth. 
In many other languages, the day precedes the month. This can cause confusion, because to some 
people 6/12 means “the sixth of December.” To English speakers it most commonly means “June 
twelfth.” To avoid such confusion, it is wise to give dates in this form: June 12, 2005.
Ordinals are also used to express fractions other than 1⁄2:
1⁄2 = one-half (not an ordinal)
1⁄4 = one-fourth (Note: One-fourth is sometimes expressed as “one-quarter” or “a quarter.”)
1⁄3 = one-third
3⁄10 = three-tenths
14⁄25 = fourteen twenty-fifths (Notice the plural formation of the ordinal when the 
accompanying number is greater than one.)
Years that precede 2000 are expressed in two parts: 1850 is said as “eighteen fifty,” 
1066 is said as “ten sixty-six.” The years that follow 1999 are said another way:
2000	
two thousand
2001	
two thousand one, or twenty oh one
2002	
two thousand two, or twenty oh two
2010	
two thousand ten, or twenty ten
2022	
two thousand twenty-two, or twenty twenty-two

Introducing yourself and others
Conversation: Meeting at a party
Todd:  Hi—you must be John’s cousin Matt, right? From San Diego?
Matt:  Correct! I just got in last night.
Todd:  I’m Todd, John’s roommate from Tech. Glad to meet you. I can assure you 
that I’m not anything like what John has told you.
Matt:  I’m happy to meet you, too—and, yes—I have heard about you! Football 
player and party animal extraordinaire.
Todd:  Football, yes—and as a matter of fact, I do like parties. But tell me more 
about yourself and what you do in San Diego.
Matt:  Well, I’m more (of) a surfer than a football player. You know, San Diego has 
a fantastic coast—and we can surf all day and then party on the beach at night.
Todd:  That sounds awesome. How long are you staying?
Matt:  Well, I’ll be here for two weeks. John has promised me a nonstop schedule—
kind of a mix of sightseeing, meeting his friends, checking out the local scene, 
and—hopefully—camping in the mountains for a couple of days.
Todd:  John’s a good guy—and you can be sure he knows the local scene. He knows 
everybody in town. I’m sure he’ll show you a good time. And his friends are here to 
help.
Matt:  Thanks so much—I really appreciate that. I’m still a bit jet-lagged at the 
moment but should be in good shape by tomorrow. I’m looking forward to hearing 
what John has in store for me. . . .
Todd:  Don’t worry. We’ll all take good care of you. And don’t be surprised if we show 
up on your doorstep in San Diego one day, ready for surfing!
Improving your conversation
I’m Todd ( Jones)
Simply using I’m and then saying your name is one way to introduce yourself. You 
could also say, for example, My name’s Todd (Jones). It is customary to offer your 
right hand in a handshake to the other person. In very informal situations, you 
could just say Hi, I’m Todd, with no handshake.
To introduce one or more people other than yourself, say:
This is (my wife,) Mary. And this is Susan, Bob, and Joe.
	
Conversation: Introductions, opinions, descriptions  	 383
To introduce more than one person and also tell how you know them, say:
These are my friends, Susan and Bob. And this is Jim, my coworker.
All of the people introduced would then shake hands. You could also say:
I want you to meet (my friends,) Susan and Bob.
Glad/happy to meet you
When you have been introduced to someone, it is customary to say (I’m) glad/happy to meet you 
or It’s nice to meet you. The reply is I’m happy to meet you or I’m happy to meet you, too. (The 
underlined words are pronounced slightly louder than the others.)
Right?
Right? is an informal way to ask for confirmation that what you have just said is true. The answer 
can be That’s right!
This train goes to Washington, right?	
That’s right.
You’re from Panama, right?	
That’s right, I am.
Correct!
This is an informal answer to a question that asks for confirmation.
You’re Matt, aren’t you?	
Correct!
This is Economics 101, right?	
Correct!
If you want to tell your questioner that he or she is not correct, you can politely say this with, 
for example:
No, that’s not right.
No, that’s not correct.
No, I’m not Matt; I’m Jim.
No, she isn’t my sister. She’s my cousin.
(The underlined words in the examples should be spoken slightly louder than the other words in 
the sentence.)
To sarcastically indicate that something is not correct, Yeah, right! is used.
Dylan, I heard you just won the lottery  
jackpot!
Yeah, right! Where did you hear 
that nonsense?
Am, do, etc.
When a yes-or-no question using the verb to be is asked, the answer can be made emphatic by 
following it with a tag, in which, if the answer is yes, the verb is said a little louder than the other 
words. Affirmative tag answers are not contracted.
Are you unhappy?	
Yes, I am.
Is he sick?	
Yes, he is.
Are we winning?	
Yes, we are.
Are they leaving?	
Yes, they are.
	
384	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
When the answer is no, there are two ways to answer with a tag. The underlined words are the 
ones said a little louder. Negative tag answers are usually contracted. The full form makes them 
more emphatic.
Are you unhappy?	
No, I’m not./No, I am not.
Is he sick?	
No, he’s not./No, he isn’t./No, he is not.
Are we winning?	
No, we’re not./No, we aren’t./No, we are not.
Are they leaving?	
No, they’re not./No, they aren’t./No, they are not.
When an information question using any verb other than to be is asked, the answer can be 
made emphatic by following it with a tag, in which the verb is said a little louder than the other 
words.
Do you eat meat?	
Yes, I do./No, I don’t./No, I do not.
Does he like school?	
Yes, he does./No, he doesn’t./No, he does not.
Do we wait in line?	
Yes, we do./No, we don’t./No, we do not.
Do they live here?	
Yes, they do./No, they don’t./No, they do not.
As a matter of fact
As a matter of fact is a common expression that has a number of different meanings. In our 
example conversation it introduces a confirmation of what was previously said. It can go before 
the main clause or after the verb.
I heard you were looking for a job.
As a matter of fact, I am!
Your friend is very good-looking; is he 
single?
He is, as a matter of fact!
You can express the same meaning with actually, but put it after the verb.
I heard you were looking for a job.
I am, actually.
Your friend is beautiful, but I’ll bet 
she’s married.
She is, actually.
Just
This use of just indicates that something happened only a short time before. It can be used with 
the past tense or with the present perfect tense. For example:
Past tense	
Present perfect tense
I just arrived.	
I have just arrived.
They just finished.	
They have just finished.
We just ate.	
We have just eaten.
He just called.	
He has just called.
To get in
To get in means to arrive and is usually used in the past tense.
What time did you get in?
They got in late last night.
Another way to say to arrive, when it refers to the future, is to get there.
I hope we get there on time.
She will get there by six.
	
Conversation: Introductions, opinions, descriptions  	 385
To get in can also mean to be accepted by a school/college/university or other group with lim-
ited membership.
He applied to that college and really hopes to get in.
She didn’t get in her first choice of sororities, but she got in another one, and she’s happy.
I can assure you that . . . /you can be sure (that) . . .
These are common ways of saying that you believe something to be true, hoping to win the con-
fidence of the person you are talking to.
I can assure you that I will work hard.
You can be sure that something interesting will happen.
Here is another way to express that you believe something to be true:
I promise you that we won’t leave until the work is done.
Party animal
Party animal is an informal expression used to characterize someone who spends a lot of time 
with friends or acquaintances for entertainment—either at home or in public places.
My friend Eric will take you downtown on Saturday night; he’s a real party animal, so you’ll 
meet lots of people.
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire is a word borrowed from French, pronounced in English “ek stra or d- NAYRE.” 
It is used to exaggerate the meaning of the previous word.
I’d like you to meet Marc—he’s our pastry chef extraordinaire. You have to try his 
cheesecake!
What do you do?
The question What do you do? asks what one’s job or occupation is. When you answer with a form 
of to be, you give a general job title. Note that the article a is always used when referring to only 
one person but is never used when referring to more than one person.
What do you do?	
I’m a lawyer.
What does he do?	
He’s a painter.
What does she do?	
She’s a banker.
What do they do?	
They’re professors.
When the answer refers to someone who has a special title or position (i.e., is the only one in 
that position), use the instead of a.
What does he do?	
He’s the president of ABC Enterprises.
What do you do?	
I’m the school secretary (the only one).
When you answer with another verb, you give more specific information about where you work.
What do you do?	
I work for a large firm.
What does he do?	
He drives a delivery truck.
What does she do?	
She works at Atlas Bank.
What do they do?	
They teach French at Loyola.
	
386	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
When a specific time or place is included in the question, the answer refers to how people 
spend their time, not just what their jobs are.
What do you do on weekends?
I relax and hang out with my friends.
What does she do at the beach?
She surfs, relaxes on the beach, and 
goes to the boardwalk for fun.
Tell me about yourself
Tell me about yourself is a polite way to let someone know that you are interested in learning more 
about him or her. It is better than asking direct questions, as the person being asked can decide 
what to tell and what not to tell. For example:
Tell me about yourself.
Well, I’m twenty-seven, I have a degree 
in mathematics, and I’ve been 
working at SYZ Company for three 
years. My parents are both 
economists, and I have a sister who’s 
a nurse and two younger brothers. 
They all live in Connecticut, where I 
was born. I’m crazy about football 
and have season tickets. I listen to 
reggae, etc.
Tell me about yourself.
Well, I’m from a small town, and I 
came here to work.
Awesome
Awesome is an expression that is used a lot—maybe too much!—to say that you think something 
is really good. Other ways to express the same thing include great, fantastic, terrific, wonderful, 
and cool.
So . . . how do you like it here?	
It’s awesome!
Did you like the movie?	
It was awesome!
Thank you for taking me— 
you’re awesome!
Nonstop schedule
Nonstop schedule describes the activities of a very busy person, whether it be because of work, 
school, family responsibilities, or even social life.
I don’t have time to see you this week, with my nonstop schedule.
Other ways to indicate nonstop activity are around-the-clock or twenty-four-seven (twenty-
four hours a day, seven days a week).
I get telephone calls around-the-clock.
He works twenty-four-seven, so I hardly ever see him.
A mix
A mix refers to a combination of different elements, usually indicating variety.
There will be a good mix of music at the wedding, to keep the grandparents, the parents, and 
the young people happy.
We invited a mix of people—family, friends, coworkers, and neighbors.
	
Conversation: Introductions, opinions, descriptions  	 387
Hopefully
Hopefully is a word inserted to indicate your wishes that something will happen. It can come in 
the middle of a verb phrase (will + hopefully + verb), before the subject, or at the end of a 
sentence.
I’ll hopefully graduate in two years.
Hopefully, I’ll graduate in two years.
I’ll graduate in two years, hopefully.
If we leave right away, hopefully we’ll arrive on time.
A couple of
A couple really means two; however, informally, it can mean more than that—but it does indicate 
a small number.
I’ll see you in a couple of hours.	
I’ll see you sometime today.
It only costs a couple of dollars.	
It costs less than five dollars.
He’ll be home in a couple of months.	
He’ll be home before the end of the year.
A good guy
Calling someone a good guy is a common way to recommend a male as being understanding of 
someone’s situation, helpful, or generous. A female with the same kind of recommendation would 
be called understanding/helpful/generous.
If you’re looking for a used car, go see Sam Smith; he’s a good guy and will probably give you 
a good price.
If you want a teaching job, call Mary Johnson; she’s very understanding and will give you 
good advice.
The local scene
The local scene refers to the culture and range of entertainment offered in a particular area.
I’m moving to Springfield next month. 
What’s the local scene like there?
Oh, it’s great! There are lots of things to do 
at night and on weekends.
To show someone a good time
To show someone a good time means to make sure he or she is entertained.
If you come visit in December, we’ll show you a good time. All our friends have parties in 
December!
Thanks so much
Thanks so much is a common way of expressing appreciation. Other ways to say this are Thank 
you very much/Thanks a lot/I really appreciate this/You’re a doll (very informal)/You’re a 
­sweetheart (very informal).
The reply to any of these could be You’re welcome/No problem/I’m glad I could help you/Glad 
to help/Any time.
Thanks so much for fixing my tire.  
I really appreciate it.
No problem.
Thank you very much for helping us.
You’re welcome. Any time.

To be in good shape
To be in good shape means to be fit financially or situationally.
My sister’s husband has a good job, so they’re in good shape financially.

A similar expression, to be in shape, means to be physically fit.

To be looking forward to something
The expression looking forward to indicates that the speaker is very happy about a future event.

To have in store for
The phrase to have in store for indicates an unknown situation that someone presents to someone

We’re going shopping tomorrow to see what the designers have in store for us this season.
He’s been working there for years, but he never knows what’s in store for him until he gets 
there.
To show up on someone’s doorstep
To show up on someone’s doorstep means to visit someone without notice. It doesn’t necessarily 
mean that you plan to stay overnight—or longer—but it’s possible.
I was just getting ready to go out when my cousin showed up on my doorstep.
Related expressions are drop in and drop by, but these are used only for short visits—never an 
overnight stay.
We were in town, so we decided to drop in to see you.
Please drop by for a while. I miss seeing you.
To show up, on the other hand, is used negatively to indicate that someone often doesn’t appear 
when expected.

Another meaning of show up, when used with a direct object, is to perform or seem better 
than someone else.

Lauren:  Well, the T-shirt was a going-away present from my brother, 
who’s a baseball player. Look on the back—it has a photo of all the players 
on his team. They actually won the city championship this summer.
Sarah:  That’s awesome. I tell you, I’m not very athletic, but I love to watch 
baseball, even if it’s a Little League game. You could say I’m a 
professional spectator. What about you, do you play a sport?
Lauren:  Yes, I play tennis. As a matter of fact, I have a scholarship, and 
I’m going to play for the university. Now tell me, what else do you like 
to do?
Sarah:  Well—what I like to do best is dance. I’m studying classical ballet, 
but I also like to dance to popular music.
Lauren:  Cool. We have a lot in common. I like to dance, too. Think you’ll

walls. It’s, like, really depressing. I prefer light colors. Plus, I’d like to 
change the rug and the bedspreads. Do you like them?
Sarah:  No, I agree with you. They’re horrible. With a couple of coats of 
paint and a few small changes, we’ll make this room comfortable and 
cozy. Everybody will want to hang out here.
Lauren:  Man, I’m so relieved! I think we’re really going to get along. I’m 
going to call my mom right now and tell her how cool my new roomie is.

character.

other. The guy sleeps all day. Sometimes he gets up just to go to his 
classes, and then he comes back to the room and goes back to bed. Then 
he’ll get up at midnight and study all night.
Eric:  Really? You don’t eat together, then?
Michael:  The truth is, I don’t even know when he eats, or where.
Eric:  Then at least he doesn’t leave a mess in the kitchen.

clean every day—and he doesn’t seem to have dirty clothes. He’s like 
a ghost.
Eric:  Man, I think you have the perfect roommate!

together a lot. I mean, we have two classes together and we’re in the same 
fraternity, so we’re really good friends.

Conversation: Running into a friend
Nicole:  Hi, Jen. What’s up? I haven’t seen you for ages.
Jen:  Nicole! Fancy running into you here. Do you have time for a cup of coffee?
Nicole:  Sure. We really need to catch up. Do you work around here?
Jen:  At the dress shop across the street. I’m a sales assistant for the time being, 
but I’m hoping they’ll promote me to buyer after I have some experience on 
the floor.
Nicole:  Oh—I love that shop. Their clothes are so trendy and different from the 
run of the mill. You look fantastic—I’ll bet their sales have gone up since you 
started working there.
Jen:  Well—I try! The thing is, I enjoy the work, because I love the clothes, and 
I like helping people find what works for them. It’s actually quite fulfilling.
Nicole:  Good for you. And I think the idea of becoming a buyer is great. Before 
you know it, you’ll be working on your own designs. I remember how you 
used to dream of being a fashion designer.
Jen:  Yeah, and I think this is a step in the right direction. Now, what are you up 
to? The last I heard, you were about to move across country. I hope you’re back 
to stay!
Nicole:  As a matter of fact, I just got back a couple of months ago. I’m glad I 
went, because now I know I really want to be here. I’m working as a waitress 
right now but am hoping to get a teaching job. I’ve applied to most of the local 
school districts so have my fingers crossed I’ll get something this fall.
Jen:  What do you want to teach? I’ve heard there are openings for high school 
teachers in Howard County.
Nicole:  No way! I haven’t even applied there. I’ll do it as soon as I get home. 
Man, that’ll be awesome if they need a biology teacher. Thanks for the tip! 
Which reminds me—waiting tables isn’t all bad. On weekends I get pretty 
good tips. And banking on the info you just gave me, I think I’ll follow you 
back to work and splurge on a new dress!
Jen:  Great. I already have in mind some things for you to try on.
Later:
Nicole:  Wow. I love this one. I guess I’m getting ahead of myself, but I have a 
feeling this is just what I need for the interview with the principal.

Dr. Sharp, hopefully sometime next week.

Lisa:  I need a complete physical for a new job I’m about to take.
Receptionist:  Do you have a form that has to be filled out?
Lisa:  Yes, I do—and it looks like I’ll need a pretty thorough exam.
Receptionist:  Can you fax it to me? That way I’ll know how much time to allot for 
your appointment.
Lisa:  Sure. Can you give me your fax number?
Receptionist:  It’s 202-739-5906.
Lisa:  Good. I’ll fax it to you right away. Will you call me back when you get it?
Receptionist:  Right.
Later:
Receptionist:  Hello, Lisa. This is Dr. Sharp’s office. I see you’re going to need an 
hour-long appointment, and Dr. Sharp won’t be able to do that for at least another 
month. I could give you an appointment with Dr. Manning next Thursday, though, 
at 1 p.m. Would you like to take that?
Lisa:  Um . . . yes, that sounds fine. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the 
exam?
Receptionist:  Yes. I know this will be difficult, but you mustn’t eat or drink anything 
after midnight the night before. I wish I could give you an appointment earlier in the 
day, but we don’t have any other openings.
Lisa:  OK. But if there is a cancellation earlier in the day, please let me know. I’d much 
rather come in early in the morning.
Receptionist:  Of course.
Lisa:  Thanks very much. Good-bye.
Conversation B: Changing a lunch date
Lisa:  Hi, Maria. It’s Lisa. Listen, I’m not going to be able to have lunch with you 
next Thursday. I have to have a physical for my new job, and it’s on Thursday at 
one o’clock—and it’s in Alexandria. I’m really sorry. Can we make it another day?
Maria:  No problem. How about Friday at 12:30?
Lisa:  Oh dear, I can’t do that, either. Could you do Wednesday?
Maria:  Look, we’re going to have to make it the following week. We’ve both got too 
much on our plates right now. Let’s say Thursday, the twenty-fourth, at one 
o’clock. OK?
Lisa:  Perfect. We’ll have a lot to talk about by then!

Expressing wants and needs
Conversation: Looking for a new apartment
Receptionist:  Good morning! How can I help you?
Ted:  I’d like to rent an apartment in this neighborhood and wonder if you can help me.
Receptionist:  You need to talk to Shirley—she’s our go-to agent for apartment 
rentals. Here, I’ll take you to her office.
Shirley:  Hello, I’m Shirley. Have a seat and tell me what kind of apartment you’re 
looking for. Is it just for you?
Ted:  Well, that depends on what’s available. I’d really rather live alone, but if I don’t 
see anything that works, I could share a bigger place with a friend of mine.
Shirley:  OK. First, tell me what you have in mind.
Ted:  The most important thing is the location. I want to be in the city, preferably in 
this neighborhood, so I can walk to the university and to the metro station. I don’t 
have a car.
Shirley:  OK, then you don’t mind if there’s no parking space.
Ted:  Exactly. But I want a secure building. I also want it to have a living room, a 
dining room, one bedroom, and, of course, a modern kitchen and bathroom. I don’t 
really need all the bells and whistles, but I would like to have a balcony.
Shirley:  And what is your budget? I mean, what monthly rent are you thinking 
about, including utilities?
Ted:  I’m hoping to find something for about $700 a month.

practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
Shirley:  Look, I can tell you right now there are no decent apartments in this area 
under $1,200 a month—and none of them have dining rooms or balconies. There 
are modern, secure buildings that are actually near the metro—but they’re at least 
six miles outside of the city.
Ted:  There’s no way I’m going to live way out there. Do you think you could find a 
two-bedroom place closer in for, say, $1,400 a month? Something I could share with 
my friend?
Shirley:  Let me do a little research this morning and see what I can find. I’m not going 
to tell you that it’s impossible, but I can’t promise anything, either. Give me a couple 
of hours to see what’s out there. If I find anything worthwhile, we can go have a look 
this afternoon. In the meantime, I need you to fill out this form so I have your 
contact information. As a matter of fact, both you and your friend will have to fill out 
an application in order to be approved as tenants. I’m assuming you want a one-year 
lease. Is that right? Oh, one more thing: you don’t have a pet, do you?
Ted:  Yes, I’m willing to sign a one-year lease, and no, I don’t have a pet. And I’ll make 
sure my friend gets rid of his dog. He can leave it with his family—they have a place 
in the country. I’d better go give him a heads-up right now.
Shirley:  Good. Be sure both of you bring your financial and credit information 
with you.
Ted:  Right. We’ll see you at noon, then. Thank you very much.
Shirley:  See you later.

Talking about future events
Conversation A: Scheduled events
Raj:  What time does the movie start?
Ines:  It starts at 7:30 and ends at 9:45.
Raj:  Good, we can go on the bus, and get back home before it’s too dark. Is there 
a bus stop near your house?
Ines:  Yes. It stops on the corner every fifteen minutes.
Raj:  Perfect. I’m looking forward to seeing this movie.
Conversation B: Plans for the very 
near future
Jenny:  What are you doing tomorrow?
Paula:  I’m going to the beach with my family for a week. We’re leaving early—
at 6 a.m.
Jenny:  Oh, nice! So I guess you’re planning to go to bed early tonight.
Paula:  Yeah, I’m gonna pack my bag and try to hit the sack by nine o’clock.
Jenny:  Good luck with that! What are you taking?
Paula:  I always pack light for the beach—a bathing suit, a couple of pairs of 
shorts, some T-shirts, a hat, and lots of sunscreen. How about you? What are 
you doing next week?
Jenny:  I’m going to stay home and catch up on some unfinished projects.
Paula:  Like what?
Jenny:  Oh, I have a long list! First I’m going to clean up my office, pay bills, 
write letters, and take care of a bunch of paperwork. Then I’m going to 
redecorate my bedroom—paint the walls and get new curtains.
Paula:  Wow. What color are you going to paint it?
Jenny:  It’s a very light blue. I’ve already picked it out and bought the paint.
Paula:  Cool.

Conversation C: Long-term plans
Emma:  What do you think you’ll do when you finish college?
Kim:  Oh, I’ll probably stay in the city and look for work here. Then I’ll go back home on 
holidays.
Emma:  I love that idea, but I’ll probably go closer to home to get a job. I like being close to my 
family and old friends. Still, life in the big city is certainly tempting!
Kim:  Well, maybe you could find a job in a big city closer to home.
Emma:  Yeah, that would be a good happy medium.
Kim:  On the other hand, since you like to travel, you could possibly get a job in another 
country—do something exotic.
Emma:  You’re right. I might get really bored just doing the same old thing. I’d learn a lot 
overseas—even pick up another language. It’s definitely something to think about.
Kim:  Well, I guess we don’t have to decide now, since we’re still in our freshman year!
Conversation D: Predictions for the more 
distant future
Teacher:  What will the world be like fifty years from now?

Emily:  I’ll bet cars will be replaced by little helicopters, so you’ll be able to fly ahead in traffic.
Holly:  There won’t be any more wars.
Julie:  Women will make more money than men.
Stacey:  No way! Women will stay home and the men will do all the work.
Joe:  There will be a better form of government.
Zack:  People will have forgotten how to talk and will only communicate electronically.
Heather:  There won’t be any disease, and people will live to be 150 years old.
Courtney:  That will be horrible. It will be so crowded!
Andy:  That’s why people will be living on Mars!
Improving your conversation
No one can say for sure what will happen in the future, yet we often talk about it. Future events 
can be described in several different ways, depending on how probable it is that they will 
happen.
Scheduled events
The present tense is used to talk about the future. It is used to give the time of scheduled events 
(99 percent probability).
The flight leaves at four o’clock this afternoon.
The movie starts at five o’clock, so don’t be late.
The present tense is also used to tell what normally happens and is expected to be the same 
in the future (99 percent probability).
The stores open at ten o’clock tomorrow morning.
The children go back to school in September.
Class ends at 3:15.
The train stops near our building every hour.
	
Conversation: Future events, narration, electronic communication 	 447
I’ll bet
The present tense is used after the expression I’ll bet, meaning I’m pretty sure it will happen.
I’ll bet she wins the election.
I’ll bet he calls me as soon as he gets home.
Going to
To be going to is used to indicate events planned for the near future (95 percent probability).
We’re going to move to our new house next month.
They’re going to get married in June.
In informal conversation, going to is often pronounced “gonna.”
I’m gonna go see my grandmother this afternoon.
The present progressive (basic verb + -ing) can be used as an alternative to going to (95 percent 
probability).
We’re moving to our new house next month.
They’re getting married in June.
We’re planning to go to the game tomorrow.
I’ll be doing homework after school.
Will probably
Will probably + basic verb is used to indicate about a 75 percent probability of happening.

We’ll probably leave early.
Probably won’t + basic verb is used to indicate about a 25 percent probability of 
happening.
He probably won’t come with me.
You probably won’t like this movie.
May/might
May or might + basic verb can be used to express about a 50 percent possibility of something 
happening.
He may be late, because he has to work until 6.
She might be late, too.
I might come over tomorrow. It depends on what time I get home.
Maybe
Maybe also expresses about a 50 percent possibility of something happening. Unlike may and 
might, it is placed before the subject.
Maybe they’ll be late.
Maybe I’ll come over tomorrow.

Narrating a story
Conversation: A traffic accident
Jack:  Hey, buddy, what happened to you? Don’t tell me you broke your leg!
Sam:  No, it’s not that drastic. I just twisted my ankle. Still, it hurts a lot, and walking 
with these crutches is a pain in the neck.
Jack:  So when did it happen?
Sam:  It was the night of the basketball championship. And the worst thing is that we 
lost the game and all hopes of winning our title back.
Jack:  What a bummer! Sit down here for a minute and tell me all about it.
Sam:  Well, it all happened last Thursday. It was pouring down rain and also freezing. 
I was in a hurry to get to the gym early to chill out a bit before the game. I was all 
stressed out about the game when I left home, but I got in the car and started to drive 
toward the gym. All of a sudden my phone rang—it was my girlfriend. She was all 
excited about the game and wanted to wish me good luck. I started to get pumped up 
and ready for the game. My girlfriend and I kept on talking when I suddenly realized 
that the cars in front of me were stopped, and I was going a little fast. I slammed on 
the brakes, but it was too late. The street was wet, and I hit the car that was stopped in 
front of me. That hard braking caused me to twist my ankle. I could hardly get out of 
the car to talk to the other driver because my ankle hurt so much. To tell you the 
truth, I was so freaked out I didn’t know what to do. I was thinking about the game, 
my girlfriend, my teammates—it never occurred to me that I wouldn’t be able to play 
that night. Finally a cop came and made me sign some papers; then an ambulance 
took me to the hospital. They took some X-rays to see if my ankle was broken or not. 
Thank goodness it wasn’t broken, but the upshot was that I wasn’t going to play 
basketball that night. And now I’m stuck with these crutches.
	
Conversation: Future events, narration, electronic communication 	 455
Improving your conversation
The example dialogue is very informal and uses only a few of the traditional markers that indicate 
the order of events in a narration.
First/second/next/then/after that
In a more formal or longer narration, chronological order can be made clearer with the use of 
expressions such as first, second, next, then, and after that. The last event in the series is pre-
ceded by finally.
First, I got into the car and started to drive toward the gym.
Second, I had an accident.
Then I realized that I had twisted my ankle.
After that, they took me to the hospital.
Finally, I went to the game on crutches and watched my team lose.
Note that each of these expressions is followed by a comma (or pause, when speaking), with the 
exception of then. Second can be replaced with then, next, or after that, which are 
interchangeable.
This is what happened at the meeting this afternoon. First, we discussed the budget; second, 
the chairman announced the new position in Human Services. Next we talked about the 
problems in Customer Service. After that, we had a short coffee break, and then we had a 
chance to ask questions. Finally, we adjourned.
Finally
Finally can also indicate relief or joy that something long awaited or expected has happened.
After three long days on the road, I finally got to San Antonio.
Finally you’re here! We expected you two hours ago.
Thank goodness
Thank goodness and thank God are other ways to express relief, joy, or satisfaction.
Thank goodness you arrived safely. Now we can celebrate.
Thank goodness and thank God (but not finally) can also express appreciation.
We have enough money to live on, thank God.
All of the children are healthy, thank goodness.
To top it all off
Sometimes a series of events are meant to tell a convincing story. To top it all off is an expression 
that is used to introduce a final event that adds weight to the sum of the previous events. Other 
expressions with the same function are for the frosting on the cake and as if that weren’t enough.
First, my alarm didn’t go off, and I woke up an hour late. Then I spilled coffee all over my 
suit and had to change clothes. After that, I got in the car and noticed that it was 
completely out of gas. Finally, I had to wait in a long line to get gas. And to top it all off, 
when I left the gas station, I was in the middle of a huge traffic jam.

All of a sudden
Events that interrupt a narration can be preceded by all of a sudden, suddenly, before I knew it, 
out of nowhere, out of the blue, and just like that—all of which mean without warning.
We were enjoying our picnic, when all of a sudden, it began to rain cats and dogs.
They were taking a test, when suddenly the fire alarm went off.
I stepped on a slippery rock, and before I knew it, I was on the ground.
He was driving down the street, and out of nowhere, a car approached from the left.
I was watching TV the other night, when out of the blue I got a call from an old friend 
whom I hadn’t seen in ages.
I was feeling a little depressed, and just like that, my favorite song came on the radio and 
cheered me up.
The best thing and the worst thing
The best thing and the worst thing indicate that what follows is the most or least desirable aspect 
of an issue.
The best thing about this school is that it has wonderful students. They are all eager to learn.
The best thing you can do at this point is be patient.
The worst thing about this apartment is the location. It’s not convenient to anything.
The upshot
The upshot of an issue is its result or outcome. This is often used to avoid telling a complete story 
or explaining an issue in detail.
I’m not going to give you all the details. The upshot is that Caitlyn has left town and won’t be 
back.
An expression that has a similar function is the bottom line.
I just had a long conversation with the chairman of the company. The bottom line is that I’ve 
been promoted.
I don’t have time to hear your whole 
story—what’s the bottom line?
The bottom line is that I got fired and 
I’m looking for a new job.
Paper
Paper has a number of meanings. Paper is the most common material used for writing, printing, 
and cleaning, and it is in many manufactured goods. In this function, it is a non-count noun and 
is not made plural.
This book is made of paper.
We need to conserve paper in order to protect our forests.
Paper can also be a count noun, and can be made plural, when it means document.
We need to fill out a whole bunch of papers when we go to the doctor.
Paper is also a count noun when it means essay, written composition, or thesis.
I have two research papers to write, so I will probably spend the weekend in the library.
A paper can refer to the newspaper. The paper can mean today’s newspaper.
She went down to the newsstand to buy a paper.
Have you read the paper yet? The news is amazing!
	
Conversation: Future events, narration, electronic communication 	 457
Bummer
A bummer is an item of bad news or bad luck.
Snow again! What a bummer! Now our flight will be canceled.
For serious occasions or tragedies, a shame would be a better expression.
I’m so sorry to hear about your dad’s illness. What a shame!
Pain in the neck
A pain in the neck can refer to anything or any person that is annoying.
I wish my sister would stop banging on the door. She really is a pain in the neck.
I lost my Internet connection again. What a pain in the neck!
Cop
Cop is a slang term that means police officer.
There are cops stationed along the turnpike, waiting for speeders.
To cop out on someone has nothing to do with the police; it means to stop participating in 
an activity in which other people are counting on you. It indicates that the speaker is unhappy 
with this decision.
We had five players for the basketball team, but Steve copped out, and now we can’t play a 
proper game.
Sandy promised to drive me to the game, but he copped out on me at the last minute, so now 
I’ll have to take the bus.
Pouring down rain
To be pouring down rain means to be raining heavily. An alternative expression is raining cats 
and dogs.
The kids can’t play outside; it’s pouring down rain.
I had to pull the car off to the side of the road because it was raining cats and dogs.
Pumped up
To be pumped (up) means to be excited. An alternative expression is to be all excited.
We are both pumped up for the concert this weekend.
She is all excited about her date with you. Where are you guys going?
Stressed out
To be stressed out means to be very tense, nervous, or worried about something.
She has two sick children at home and is trying to work at the same time. No wonder she is 
stressed out!
Another way to express this feeling is to say that something stresses you out.
Having two sick children at home really stresses me out.

Creeped out
To be creeped out means to be disgusted or frightened by something. Also, something can creep 
you out.

It creeps me out that he just sits there and never says a word.
Another way to indicate disgust is to be grossed out.
It really grosses me out when the kids have food fights.
Stuck with
To be stuck with means to have to cope with an uncomfortable or undesirable situation.

Conversation: Future events, narration, electronic communication 	 465
Electronic conversation
While face-to-face conversations are still considered to be the best ones, people everywhere are 
depending more and more on electronic devices for communication. Apart from the fixed tele-
phone, which has been around since 1876—and is still going strong—conversations are now also 
carried on through cell phones, e-mail, and other electronic devices.
E-mail
E-mail (electronic mail) enables written conversations that are either typed on a computer or cell 
phone keyboard or entered on a touch screen on a cell phone or other electronic device. These 
messages are then sent to the desired recipient via the Internet. In order to use e-mail, you need 
to have an e-mail address, and you need to know the e-mail address of the person with whom 
you wish to communicate.
E-mail addresses can be assigned by the company that provides an Internet connection or 
through companies that issue subscriptions through the Internet. An e-mail address begins with 
a series of numbers or letters (of the individual’s choosing), followed by the symbol @ (pro-
nounced “at”), and then followed by the name of the provider, a period (pronounced “dot”), and 
finally a suffix of two or three more letters that indicates the domain—the type of organization 
that is providing the e-mail account. Here are some examples of these final domain letters:
com	
commercial (the most widely used suffix; preferred by businesses)
edu	
education (for schools, colleges, and universities)
gov	
government (for government organizations)
net	
network (most commonly used by Internet service providers)
org	
organization (primarily used by nonprofit groups and trade 
  associations)
The suffix can alternatively indicate the name of the source country. For example:
au	
Australia
es		
Spain
mx	
Mexico
uk	
United Kingdom
IM
An IM is an “instant message,” designed to get the immediate attention of the person contacted. 
Electronic devices give an audible signal when an IM is received.
Texting
Texting is the practice of sending written messages from one cell phone to another, using the 
receiver’s telephone number.
Texters often leave out the vowels in words or make up abbreviations in order to communi-
cate faster. For example:
cd		
could
cls	
class
cn		
can
hv	
have
prnts	
parents
sndy	
Sunday
tchr	
teacher
wd	
would

Tweeting
Tweeting is the practice of sending written messages to the general public through a commercial 
website, called twitter.com. Messages are limited to 140 characters. Important or famous people 
often use this to keep their constituents, clients, or fans informed of what they are doing or 
thinking.
Acronyms
Acronyms are combinations of letters that are used as abbreviations to replace words and expres-
sions. Acronyms and other symbols are commonly used in e-mail, texting, and tweeting. They 
may be in all capital (uppercase) letters, all lowercase letters, or a combination of the two. There 
are really no rules!
Following is a list of commonly used acronyms and other symbols:

Some Important Contrasts
As you study English and become more and more proficient, you will become 
aware that there are native speakers who say things that break the rules of good 
grammar. The more you know about English, the more you’ll discover that this is 
true. Natives in all languages speak at different levels of competency. Some speak 
with great grammatical accuracy. Others are more casual or just careless and dis-
regard the rules for good language. 
The following eight pairs of words demonstrate where natives frequently 
make errors. By being aware of these words, you can make a choice for yourself 
about how you wish to speak English: speaking and writing accurately, or con-
forming to casual or careless habits.
Bad and badly
It is obvious that bad is an adjective and badly is an adverb. However, some native 
English speakers use bad exclusively as both an adjective and an adverb. The prob-
lem probably derives from the fact that bad seems like an adverb when it follows a 
linking verb (to be, to become, to seem, to appear, etc.):
That’s too bad.
She looks bad this morning.
You can review linking verbs in Unit 5 on verbs.
You might hear someone say, “That little boy reads and writes bad.” How-
ever, in this usage an adverb is required. The sentence should be, “That little boy 
reads and writes badly.” Let’s look at some examples of how bad and badly should 
be used correctly:
You’re a bad dog.	
(adjective modifying dog)
In bad weather we stay at home.	
(adjective modifying weather)
Your cut isn’t so bad.	
(adjective following linking verb is)
His reply sounded bad.	
(adjective following linking verb sounded)
You have a badly broken wrist.	
(adverb modifying participle broken)
They played badly today.	
(adverb modifying verb played)
Good and well
This pair of words is misused in much the same way as bad and badly and for 
some of the same reasons. But there is extra confusion involved with good and 
well because the word well can be either an adjective or an adverb, depending 
upon its usage. Well is the adverbial form of good, and it is also a word that means 
not ill when used as an adjective.
·30·
	
Some Important Contrasts	 471
Good is the opposite of bad and is an adjective. Notice how the adjectival and adverbial 
meanings of this word are used:
Adjective	
Adverb
Miguel is a good soccer player.	
Miguel plays soccer well.
If good means “kind,” you can use kindly as its adverbial part:
Adjective	
Adverb
David is a good man.	
He always speaks so kindly of them.
But when well is used with a linking verb, it is an adjective. You might hear someone say, “I don’t 
feel good.” That usage is incorrect, for the meaning here is “not ill.” The correct usage is “I don’t 
feel well.”
But that is not the end of the story of good and well. They both can follow linking verbs, and 
they both are in that instance considered adjectives. However, their meanings are different:
Sentence with Linking Verb	
Meaning
She looks good.	
She ­doesn’t look bad.
She looks well.	
She ­doesn’t look ill.
They are good.	
They aren’t bad. OR They aren’t unkind.
They are well.	
They aren’t ill.
Few and a few
The difference between the words in this pair is not great. It is correct to say, “Few men are strong 
enough.” You can also say, “A few men are strong enough.” But there is a slight difference in 
implication between the sentences. Let’s look at some examples that will demonstrate this 
­difference:
The Sentence	
The Implication
Few people saw this movie.	
Not many people went to see this movie. 
	
	
(There is a negative implication here.)
A few people saw this movie.	
Some people saw this movie but not a lot. 
	
	
(The implication is more positive.)
Few students understood him.	
He was hard to understand. 
	
	
(There is a negative implication here.)
A few students understood him.	
Some of the students did understand him. 
	
	
(This implication is more positive.)
She has few friends.	
She has almost no friends. 
	
	
(There is a negative implication here.)
She has a few friends.	
She has some friends but not a lot. 
	
	
(This implication is more positive.)
Use few to imply a negative point of view about something. Use a few to show a more positive 
point of view.

Fewer and less
Many people misuse these two words. But their usage is quite simple: Use fewer to modify plural 
nouns and use less to modify singular (and often collective) nouns. Fewer is the comparative of 
few, and less is the comparative of little. Some examples:
Plural Nouns	
Singular Nouns
I have fewer books.	
I have less money.
We need fewer jobs to do.	
She has less time than usual.
Fewer and fewer friends came to visit.	
Mom has less and less patience with him.
Now let’s compare the positive and comparative forms of these words:
Positive	
Comparative
He has few ideas.	
He has fewer ideas than you.
February has few days.	
February has fewer days than March.
I have little time.	
I have less time now than a year ago.
She has little pain.	
She has less pain today than yesterday.
Lay and lie
Many English speakers confuse these two verbs. Lay is a transitive verb and takes a direct object. 
Lie is intransitive and does not take a direct object but is often followed by a prepositional phrase 
showing a location.
He lays the baby on the bed.	
(transitive/direct object = baby)
Where did you lay my book?	
(transitive/direct object = book)
Hamburg lies on the Elbe River.	
(intransitive/prepositional phrase with on)
Your coat is lying over the railing.	
(intransitive/prepositional phrase with over)
Confusion arises between these two verbs because of their conjugations. Compare them in 
all the tenses and take particular note of the past tense of to lie:
	
	
	
to lay	
to lie
Present	
he lays	
he lies
Past	 	
he laid	
he lay
Present Perfect	
he has laid	
he has lain
Past Perfect	
he had laid	
he had lain
Future	
he will lay	
he will lie
Future Perfect	
he will have laid	
he will have lain
If there is any difficulty deciding whether to use lay or lie, substitute put for the verb. If it 
makes sense, use lay. If it ­doesn’t, use lie.
He puts the baby on the bed. (makes sense) ➞ He lays the baby on the bed.
She puts on the bed and sleeps. (makes no sense) ➞ She lies on the bed and sleeps.
Little and a little
This pair of words is similar to few and a few. Little has a negative implication. A little shows a 
more positive point of view. Some examples:
The Sentence	
The Implication
Little is known about him.	
Not much is known about him.
	
	
(There is a negative implication here.)
	
Some Important Contrasts	 473
A little is known about him.	
Something is known about him but not a lot. 
	
	
(This implication is more positive.)
She does little work.	
She ­doesn’t work much. 
	
	
(There is a negative implication here.)
She does a little work.	
She does some work but not much. 
	
	
(This implication is more positive.)
He says little.	
He ­doesn’t say much. 
	
	
(There is a negative implication here.)
He says a little.	
He says something but not much. 
	
	
(This implication is more positive.)
Than and then
In rapid conversation these words are rarely confused, even though they sound so much alike. 
But in writing they must be distinguished. Than can be used as a preposition or a conjunction 
and stands between two elements that are being compared: Marisa is taller than Anthony. She 
runs faster than you do.
The word then has two major functions: (1) it can be used as an adverb and answers the ques-
tion when, or (2) it can be a conjunction and combines two clauses with the meaning “and as a 
consequence or thereafter.” Let’s compare these two functions:
Adverb 	
Conjunction
We were in Mexico then, too.	
I found the book then returned to my room.
Then I decided to go to college.	
She slapped his face, then she ran down the street.
Who and whom
These two words are used frequently, and often misused. Who is the form used as the subject of a 
question:
Who sent you?
Who knows the man over there?
Whom is used as a direct object, indirect object, or the object of a preposition:
direct object ➞ Whom did you meet at the party?
indirect object ➞ (To) Whom will you give an invitation?
object of preposition ➞ With whom was he sitting?
Refer to Unit 22 on interrogatives for a review of who and whom.
It is important to remember that many native speakers of English avoid whom and use who 
exclusively. Compare these sentences:
Standard English	
Casual English
Whom did they arrest?	
Who did they arrest?
From whom did you get the gift?	
From who did you get the gift? OR
	
	
Who did you get the gift from?
When speaking or writing formally, you should use the standard forms of who and whom. 
In casual letters or conversation you can be the judge and avoid whom.

Phrasal verbs
Phrasal verbs are verbs that are combined with other words—prepositions and 
adverbs—to form a new meaning, often a meaning that is radically different from 
the meaning of the verb alone. Because there are hundreds of such constructions, 
this chapter illustrates only a sampling of high-frequency verbs that form com-
monly used phrasal verbs.
common verb + adverb and/or preposition
to hold + up (to rob)
When an adverb, a preposition, or a combination of both is attached to a 
verb, the conjugation of the verb is not altered. It is the meaning and, therefore, 
the use of the verb that is changed. Let’s look at the common verb to come to see 
how its meaning changes in a few phrasal verb forms:
to come to	
to regain consciousness
to come up to	
to approach
to come up with	
to create, or to discover
Compare the use of these three phrasal verbs with a standard verb in the fol-
lowing examples:
When Jane came to, she didn’t know where she was.
When Jane regained consciousness, she didn’t know where she was.
I came up to the weary horse and patted its nose. 
I approached the weary horse and patted its nose.
How did you come up with so much money?
How did you find so much money?
In order to deal with phrasal verbs effectively, a student of English should 
have a dictionary that specializes in phrasal verbs. This is an important tool 
for identifying phrasal verbs and for understanding their meanings and uses.
Be
Many phrasal verbs are formed from the verb to be. Let’s look at three of them: to 
be in or out, to be with it, and to be up to something.
The phrasal verb to be in, as noted in Chapter 8, conveys that a person is at 
home or in the office, while to be out means a person is away from home or away 
·31·

from the office. In addition, to be out can indicate that someone is “out” having fun. For 
example:
Little Michael is in for the day and taking a nap.
What time will Dr. Schultz be in?
Why were you out so late last night?
My dentist is out for the day.
The second phrasal verb under this heading, to be with it, suggests fashionability or aware-
ness of the latest trends. Used in the negative, it can mean that someone is not up to date or not 
in touch with pop culture. 
Andrea has another new dress. She’s always so with it.
Poor Bill still can’t dance. He’s just not with it.
To be up to something (sometimes to be up to no good) conveys that someone looks suspi-
cious and has some kind of evil intentions.
What’s that man doing? I think he’s up to something.
I knew you were up to something when I saw you holding a shovel.
Her children are always up to no good.
With this phrasal verb, it is usual to follow the word something with an appropriate adjective; for 
example: I think he’s up to something illegal. When adding an adjective in this manner, it is also 
possible to change something to anything when the sentence is negated: I don’t think they’re up to 
anything wrong.
Break
Among the phrasal verbs that can be formed with the verb to break are to break down and to 
break up. The use of the words up and down may suggest that these are opposites, but that is not 
the case.
The phrasal verb to break down has two meanings: (1) to stop working (such as in reference 
to a mechanical device); and (2) to give in to one’s emotions or someone’s demands. For 
example:
How often does this computer break down?
The day had been awful, and she broke down and cried.
We questioned the thief for hours, and he finally broke down and confessed.
The phrasal verb to break up carries the sense of causing someone to laugh aloud. It suggests 
that the actions or words in question were so funny that the person could not control his or her 
amusement.
Maria’s joke broke everyone up.
The clown’s silly antics always broke the audience up.
The same construction has a radically different meaning and use when followed by the prep-
osition with. It means that one person is ending a romantic relationship with another person: to 
break up with someone.
After five months of dating, she knew she had to break up with Tom.
He no longer loved her. It was time to break up.
	
Phrasal verbs	 479
Breeze
The phrase to breeze through refers to the ability to carry out a task with ease or dispatch.
Don breezed through his workday and set off for his date with Tina.
No one ever breezes through Professor Chang’s exams.
Count
Do not confuse the usage to count (on)—that is, in the sense of to calculate by using one’s fin-
gers—with the phrasal verb to count on, which means to rely on. The preposition upon sometimes 
replaces on in the phrasal meaning.
The little boy counted on his fingers.
I know I can count on you for your support.
You shouldn’t have counted on Jim to give you any help in moving.

Cut
The verb cut can be combined with the preposition out: to cut (something) out. Meanings of this 
phrasal verb include (1) to stop doing something; (2) to eliminate or cast out someone or some-
thing; and (3) to clip out or excise a shape from something. Here are some examples:
Cut that out! You’re being too noisy!
Why cut me out? I spent as much time on the project as anyone. 
Maria cut out a cartoon from the newspaper.
I’ll cut a recipe out of the magazine.
This kind of phrasal verb is special in that the object of the verb can either precede or follow 
the preposition out if that object is a noun. Pronouns can only precede the preposition. Don’t 
forget that prepositions in phrasal verbs can serve as adverbs: 
noun direct object + preposition
I cut an interesting article + out for you.
preposition + noun direct object
I cut out + an interesting article for you.
pronoun direct object + preposition
I cut it + out for you.
This flexibility occurs with many phrasal verbs—but not with all. This characteristic is iden-
tified in reference to other phrasal verbs in the remainder of this chapter as the “flexible position” 
of a preposition. Be aware that many of these prepositions are not functioning as prepositions in 
these sentences; they are functioning as adverbs. In the phrasal verb to call (someone) up—mean-
ing either to phone someone or to conscript someone for military service—up is used as an 
adverb. Consider the following sentence:
They called up my brother to serve two years in the army.
In this sentence, the words up my brother do not constitute a prepositional phrase. Instead, up 
modifies the verb call, and my brother is a direct object.
	
Phrasal verbs	 481
Drop
When to drop is combined with in, the new phrasal verb means to stop at someone’s home for a 
short visit. To specify what person is being visited, the preposition on is added. Here are some 
examples:
My parents dropped in last night around eight.
When you’re in town, please drop in on us.
I never drop in on Michael unexpectedly.
End
When up is added to the verb to end, the phrase takes on either of two distinct meanings: (1) to 
reach completion or termination; or (2) when the preposition with is added, to find oneself in the 
company of someone or in possession of something—usually a result that is unwanted or unpleas-
ant. Let’s look at some examples:
These meetings won’t end up until tomorrow after two p.m.
Professor Hill ended the lecture up with a few words of advice.
After her date with Jim, Maria ended up with a bad cold.
I wanted to dance with Martin! How did I end up with Michael?
Sometimes to end up with is stated as to wind up with. They mean the same thing:
He ended up with no money at all.	
He wound up with no money at all.
The preposition in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
She ended up the discussion with a little joke.
She ended the discussion up with a little joke.
She ended it up with a little joke.
Follow
When to follow is combined with up, and sometimes on, the phrasal verb means to examine 
something that has been done, or to evaluate how someone has performed. Some examples:
I’ll follow up on Maria’s progress with a report.
The detective decided to follow up the new clue.
The reporter was following up on the strange story.
When the preposition up is used without on in this phrasal verb, up has a flexible position 
around the object:
We should follow that report up.
We should follow up that report.
We should follow it up.
Fool
The verb to fool is synonymous with to deceive. However, when around is attached to the verb, 
new meanings emerge: (1) it means to hang about idly; (2) when the preposition with is added, it 
	
482	
practice makes perfect  Complete English All-in-One for ESL Learners
means to do something wasteful or useless; and (3) when used with the preposition on instead, it 
means to be unfaithful. Here are some examples:
There was nothing else to do, so we just fooled around in the park.
Why are you fooling around with that old radio?
If you’re fooling around on me, I want you to tell me now.
Get
Several phrasal verbs are formed with the verb to get. Two that are worth discussion are to get 
away (with) and to get at.
When to get away is used alone, it means to escape or to move away from a location. The 
addition of the preposition with changes the meaning: the new phrase means to carry out an evil 
act without punishment. Look at these examples:
The prisoner dug a tunnel from his cell and tried to get away.
Get away from the window. It’s drafty there.
He thought he got away with his crime, but he was arrested last week.
Get at has three meanings: (1) to put one’s hands on or attack someone; (2) to hint at some-
thing; and (3) to begin discussing something. Some examples:
The bully was trying to get at me, but my friends held him back.
I don’t understand. What are you getting at?
It’s time we finally get at the heart of the matter and solve this problem.

Phrasal verbs	 483
Have
Have is another high-frequency verb that can form numerous phrasal verbs. One that bears anal-
ysis is the phrase to have something against. This combination of words means to harbor an atti-
tude of disrespect or dislike. Some examples:
What do you have against me? I never did anything to you.
Anna had something against Bob and let him know it.
I have nothing against apple pie. I just don’t want any.
Notice that with the third example, something changes to nothing in the negative. When this 
phrase is negated with not, the word anything is used: I don’t have anything against apple pie.
When have is combined with on another meaning is derived. It is synonymous with wear. 
For example:
Why do you have that old shirt on?
When the postman came to the door, I didn’t have anything on.
I love the blouse you gave me. I have it on right now.
Lay
The phrasal verb to lay off (of) has two meanings: (1) often followed by the preposition of, it means 
to stop bothering or harassing someone; (2) used without of, it means to end a person’s employ-
ment. The latter meaning is sometimes accompanied by the preposition from. The following 
examples illustrate the variants:
Lay off (of) me! You have no right talking to me like that!
Tom just won’t lay off (of) the man who scratched his new car.
Business was bad, and the boss had to lay the men off (from their jobs).
The preposition off in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
Mr. Jones laid the whole staff off.
Mr. Jones laid off the whole staff.
Mr. Jones laid everyone off.
Lead
When the verb to lead is followed by the preposition on, the phrase has the normal meaning of to 
continue to lead, but when a direct object is included, its meaning becomes to tantalize some-
one—often with the idea of love or romance. These examples shed further light:
Lead on, sir. These men will follow you anywhere.
Are you just leading me on? I can’t believe your story is true.
The woman was leading Bill on. She just wanted his money.
The preposition on in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
Why are you leading on that nice young man?
Why are you leading that nice young man on?
Why are you leading him on?

Let
Combining the verb let with the preposition down yields a phrasal verb that means to disappoint 
someone. It can also have the meaning of to ease up in an activity. Consider these examples:
Don’t let me down. Please lend me the money.
John knew he was letting her down when he couldn’t help her move.
Don’t let down now. You’ve got only a mile left to go in the marathon.
The preposition down in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
We can’t let down Uncle Bill.
We can’t let Uncle Bill down.
We can’t let him down.
When the verb let is followed by on, the phrase means to be obvious or to provide knowledge 
or information. Add the preposition about to cite the topic of the information. To cite the recipi-
ent of the information, add the preposition to. Here are some examples:
Don’t let on that you know me.
You mustn’t let on to Robert about the accident we had.
She didn’t let on to me about it, but I guessed the truth.
Make
The verb to make has a variety of uses and can form many phrasal verbs. Here, just a salient few 
are considered. 
To make of has three primary meanings: (1) to interpret someone or something; (2) to make 
a success of oneself; and (3) in the construction to make something of it, to invite someone to fight. 
Here are examples:
I don’t know what to make of this note from Karen. What does it mean?
John has made something of himself and has become rich in the process.
Yes, I took your books! Do you want to make something of it?
Followed by the preposition up, the verb to make produces a few new meanings: (1) to fabri-
cate or lie; (2) to apply cosmetics; (3) often with the pronoun it and using the preposition to, to 
compensate a person for something; and (4) accompanied by the preposition with, to reconcile.
I confess. I made the whole story up.
Two women were making the bride up for her wedding.
Tom promised to make it up to me, but nothing ever happened.
Robert made up with Carmen, but she was still angry.
The preposition up in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
John made up another excuse.
John made another excuse up.
John made it up.
If you use the preposition for with to make up, the phrasal verb means to compensate for 
something that was done.
I hope this check will make up for the problem you had with our product.
You can’t make up for such bad behavior.
	
Phrasal verbs	 485
When to make up is used with the object the bed, the reference is to putting fresh sheets and 
coverings on a mattress. With that meaning, the preposition up again has a flexible position 
around the object:
Let’s make up the bed.
Let’s make the bed up.
Let’s make it up.

	10.	 I think it was cruel of you to                      Jake                     . 
(tantalize with the idea of love)
Pass
When the verb pass is followed by away, a new meaning is produced: to die. This expression is 
often used in place of to die in order to blunt the reality and impart a tone of compassion. When 
the verb pass is followed by the phrase off as, the meaning of the phrasal verb is to represent that 
someone or something is different from what it really is. Some examples:
Old Mrs. Jarvis passed away last night.
The man tried to pass the pretty girl off as his daughter.
The crooked dealer thought he could pass off an old chair as an antique.

The preposition off in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
He passed off a forgery as the real thing.
He passed a forgery off as the real thing.
He passed it off as the real thing.
Set
With the addition of the preposition back, the verb to set has three new meanings: (1) followed by 
the preposition from, to move something away from other things; (2) to change the time on the 
clock to an earlier time; and (3) to cause a temporary failure or delay.
I set the stack of books back from my work space. I needed more room to write.
Tomorrow we have to set all the clocks back an hour.
The broken equipment set us back a whole week in completing the job.
When to set is followed by off, it has four primary new meanings: (1) to anger someone; (2) 
to cause something to explode or go off; (3) followed by the preposition on, to depart for a jour-
ney; and (4) followed by the preposition for, to depart for a specific destination. Some examples:
Jim’s cruel remark really set Anna off. She began to scream at him.
The bomb was set off by a remote detonator.
The next morning we set off on the short trip to Sun Valley.

Who set off the alarm?
That set my boss off.	
Who set the alarm off?
That set him off.	
Who set it off?
Stand 
When to stand is combined with for, the phrasal verb has two meanings: (1) to symbolize some-
thing; and (2) to tolerate something. Look at these examples:
The American flag stands for freedom and democracy.
I won’t stand for your rude behavior any longer.
Take
When to take is combined with back, it has three meanings: (1) to return something; (2) to trigger 
a memory of something; and (3) to retract something. 
I took the tools I borrowed back to Jim.
Hearing that song takes me back to when I was still in college.
Take that back! You know that’s not true!
The adverb back in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
Mark won’t take back the money.
Mark won’t take the money back.
Mark won’t take it back.
	
Phrasal verbs	 487
Another phrasal verb is formed with to take and the preposition up. It has four primary 
meanings: (1) to raise the hem of a garment; (2) sometimes using the preposition with, to discuss 
a subject; (3) to be involved in an activity; and (4) followed by the preposition on, to agree to a 
proposal. Here are examples of each:
That dress is too long. Take it up a couple inches.
The committee took up the problem of recycling plastics.
I need to take up the question of Jim’s employment with you.
My daughter has taken up stamp collecting.
I’d like to take them up on their offer to buy my house.
The preposition up in this phrasal verb has a flexible position around the object:
My cousin took up the piano.
My cousin took the piano up.
My cousin took it up.
Walk
The verb to walk when followed by out means to leave, or to exit. When the preposition on is 
added, the meaning is altered: to abandon something or to jilt someone.
Why did you walk out on the last act of the play?
I don’t understand why she walked out on Jim. Does she have a new boyfriend?
Warm
When to warm is followed by up, it means to make something warm by placing it over a heat 
source or that something is becoming warm. When the preposition to is added to this phrase, a 
different meaning results: to become comfortable with a person or situation.
It will start warming up around the middle of April.
As soon as I met Jake, I warmed up to him right away.
At first I thought the idea was silly, but I soon warmed up to it.
Water
When you add down to the verb to water, the phrase conveys that a liquid is being diluted, or that 
someone’s efforts are being reduced in effectiveness.
The bartender watered down the whiskey to reap a few more dollars.
If you water down that solution any further, it won’t clean anything.

Other parts of speech
If a phrasal verb is transitive, it can be used to form the passive voice. The verb in the phrasal verb 
is formed as a past participle and is introduced by the auxiliary to be. For example:
The two brothers were cut out of the will.
The stew still has to be warmed up.
Many phrasal verbs can be used as nouns. In some cases, they are combined as one word by 
means of a hyphen, and in other instances they are written as one word. 
The children played on the floor with the cutouts.
After a hard winter, we’re hoping for a quick warm-up.
In addition, nouns and past participles formed from phrasal verbs can act as adjectives:
◆ Nouns as adjectives
The getaway car was a black SUV.
We’ll present a follow-up report tomorrow.
◆ Participles as adjectives
The laid-off workers began to plan a protest.
